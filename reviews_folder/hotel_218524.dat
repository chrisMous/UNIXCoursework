<Content>Perfect Honeymoon!!!! We had the most wonderful time at the Excellence. We opted for the Excellence Club and it was well worht it for the perks. Roberto Puello who was the Club Manager did an extra special job of making us feel welcomed! We took some great pictures that looked like postcards. The food was excellent the Pizza was close to being our favorite. The shows were great especially the Michael Jackson and the 70's  80's night. The French resturant was probably our favorite. We will definately be back for an anniversary trip. We made some friends but had plenty of privcacy as well. The rooms were great and everytime we left and came back it was cleaned, towels restocked and the bar was as well!

<Content>A truly fantastic place Xmas  We have just returned from a 2 week Xmas  New Year break at the Excellence Punta Cana. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. The restaurants are great, with plenty of choice. The whole complex is so good that we only did one trip and that was for my wife to swim with the dolphins! Great beaches and pools. The staff fall over each other to look after you! We stayed in a junior suite on ground level and it was spotlessly clean, great maid service and room service on tap 24/7. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am extremely fussy! The journey to the resort is a little uncomfortable, with the roads in a bad state. But once you are checked in the pace of life slows down and you forget about the outside world!Worthy of special mention and our sincere thanks are:Pedro from the Cielo bar/pool an absolute gentleman. Miguel the Bell Boy and also Carlos from the Skay bar.We will definately be booking again, probably for next Christmas!Jim  Eileen (Telford UK)

<Content>too sick to enjoy The ride to and form the airport is not good. Very bumpy road and you can really see the poor living conditions. When you get to the resort it is like another world. we were told not to drink the tap or shower water- keep your mouth shut in the shower etc. but we have since heard that not all properties in punta cana have a water problem. In some resorts they have a huge purification system and the tap water is safe. Both my husband and I were sick with diarrhea while we were there and put it down to the unclean water used to prepare food. We will not go on any more holidays where we have to worry about our health. Each night at about 10PM when we were settling down to sleep the music started up and we like fresh air but we had to close our patio doors to mute the sound. We really wanted a quieter resort. It was disappointing. It was partially our fault for not doing our research properly. Some people did not hear the bands play at night but we couldnt change our swim up room for a quieter one. We will not be returning to Dominican Republic.

<Content>Relaxing and fun, BUT... I rang in the New Year at Excellence Punta Cana! since New York was FREEZING at the time, I was just happy to be in the sun. My husband and I had a great time overall. However, I was a little surprised to see this hotel rating itself as a 5-star facility (more like a 4). All of the basics were covered, but some of the details that I would expect from a 5-star place were missing. The bed, although comfortable creaked loudly and I couldn鈥檛 tell whether or not the headboard was attached properly. The staff were friendly and helpful overall, but in keeping up with the island mentality, their sense of urgency was lacking (We had to ask two different people for hand towels and our one small room service order took close to an hour to arrive). Actually, as mentioned by another reviewer, the food was the worst part. The presentation was excellent (clean buffet areas, nicely decorated theme restaurants), but the dinner food quality wasn鈥檛 the best. One night I didn鈥檛 even finish my meal (at the 鈥淢exican鈥?restaurant on-site). Lunch (indoor buffet or beach BBQ) was usually the best bet. Actually, everything on the beach 鈥搃ncluding the wait staff鈥攚as great!Considering all of this, the Excellence was a great setting for relaxation. The grounds were beautiful, the weather was pleasant and there were many options for activities (and spa treatments) if you wanted them. I would definitely go back.One note- coordinate travel to and from the hotel beforehand if you can. The hotel is over an hour away from the airport, so you'll want to skip the can I help you, sir? bidding wars between different transportation companies.One more note- the resort is on the Atlantic side of the ocean. That means rough seas and cold(er) water. If you intend to spend your entire vacation in the ocean, you may want to skip this place. I went in a few times, but I quickly became content just relaxing by the water when I couldn鈥檛 go in it.

<Content>Somewhat Excellence We just returned from a one week stay at Excellence Punta Cana from Dec27th to Jan4th.We are seasoned travelers and have stayed at a dozen all inclusives. We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana in 2007 for two weeks, then Excellence Mayan Riviera and then Playa Mujeres and now just returned from our second time to Punta Cana. We love Excellence... .So here goes The staff at excellence I rate 5 star all the way they are an amazing group of people friendly hard working and makes your stay wonderful.Pool beach and grounds a solid five star can't say more then wow .Now for the rooms we traveled as three couples all oceanview excellence Club seen all three rooms and they are all in need of work the rooms are showing there age all over the place a 4 rating is generous.Food a 3 rating very incosistent cold most of the time under cooked over cooked, the new ala carte menus has less selection and was not impressed at all. Desserts terriable . Deffinately a great decline since our last trip two years ago.Excellence Club we did it in 2007 and that is why we all choose to do it again I rate it a three the only thing good was the view and the ability for late check out as we had a late flight home. But for its service I rate it a 3...Excellence club was closed upon our late arrival so they gave us our keys and sent us on our way in pitch darkness we knew where we where going so we led the other two couples we traveled with too their rooms. Not impressed.Their service was VERY inconsistent beach towels in all of our three club rooms only once. Went to excellence Club three times for a channel changer in the end tipped staff and they got one from an unoccupied room. Turn down hit and miss had to ask for bathroom amenities, Would not exchange any liquor bottles in room which they did the first time we where there. The club lounge it self which used to have plenty of food to choose from literally had nothing during the day and evening cheese some fruit and bread not at all like it was excellence club has deteriated there service BIG TIME!!! The staff tended better to you then excellence club staff. We requested top floor for all three rooms and after all our returns we thought that was not an unreasonable request and we did not get one top floor room. Save your money and shame on you excellence Club for your lack of service. All three rooms had very inconsistne fridge stalking and was only resolved with a tip and even then once when givin a tip was not done.I will not be returning to Excellence Punta Cana and it is sliding down the charts for a reason. In saying all this we traveled with two other couples and we all had a fabulous time we just feel we did not get what we pated for. Anyone with questions please do not hesitate to contact me

<Content>Beautiful resort but be careful of a few things..... My husband and I just got back from a one-week trip to this resort.Our vacation did not start well. This hotel OVERBOOKS the nicest rooms. When we arrived they immediately downgraded us b/c they did not have the room we booked available. There was also an issue of miscommunication b/w our travel agent and the hotel and the hotel staff was TOTALLY unhelpful in resolving the issue. We had to do all of the legwork ourselves. At one point the concierge told us they could not phone our travel agency b/c that phone call would cost $. Really? That's customer service??Once all was resolved and we were in our proper room, the trip was wonderful. The property is gorgeous and well maintained. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and the food was as good or better than anything we've had in the Carribean. Apart from the front desk staff, all of the other employees are very friendly and helpful. Booking the Excellence Club is worth it - just make sure the documents you get back from your travel agency clearly state that your booking includes the Club.

<Content>A varied but good experience We choose Excellence due to their very good reviews. Some broad observations on what have said.Distance- yes it's a good hour from the airport. We enjoyed the ride through the countryside and small towns. You're going to be in a bubble at an all-inclusive anyway; why not see some of the real island on the way?Rooms- we lucked out. Requested and got a ground floor corner non-smoking room. We also got a partial ocean view and strong sounds of the surf. Semi private patio with a single hammock. After walking around we saw how lucky we were. The majority of the rooms overlook a small interior garden or the grounds- no pool or ocean locations. The bed was VERY hard. The room was large and comfortable, but had problems with the toilet- dripped. They came right away to fix it- twice. The shower was small-average size. Nice marble walls, plastic floor, drop ceiling with acoustic tile. The room had crown moulding. Usually a very nice touch. Theirs was thin and in bad need of a paint job. The jacuzzi tub was fun, but the jets were not very powerful or well placed. The TV got a good number of stations, but the VCR didn't work- not a big deal for us. Food. The restaurant service was very good and very fun. At each restaurant, the hostess escort the women, by the arm, to your table. Their house wine, Chard, Savanion Blanc, Cab, and Merlot were all quite good. The food itself was mixed. An example was the Mediterranean restaurant. My wife had to send back the Kibbe (she lived in the Middle East for 6 years and knows what the food really tastes like.) On the flip side, the pear/goat cheese salad was spot on. All the portions are small, but the dinners- 3-4 courses served over a hour's time- filled us up by the end. The plating was all very well done. Beach- hard surf, sand colored sand that is very fine. Surf was very good for body surfing, but not good for bobbing. Spa- they push it; it's how they make their money. We did a free 1 hour hot tub tour they do to get guests to buy massages, etc. Frankly, I thought the building left a bit to be desired. Compared to other resorts- notably Ibrostar- theirs wasn't much to write home about. Very nice, yes. But certainly not world-class architecture. We didn't take any treatments, so can't comment about them.Overall- these resorts, like other vacations and like life in general- is what you make it. We went to relax, to be pampered, to have a good time and we did. We found the people- both in and out of the resort- to be extremely pleasant and proud of their island. All the staff were joy to interact with. Would we go back? No; because we would want to try other places and islands, not because we had a bad time. We would recommend it to others. Just realize that 5 star in the DR is not what 5 star in a Western country would be.

<Content>Definitely not a 5 star resort I'm dumbfounded that this hotel gets good reviews and is so highly rated. It's decidedly a 3 star property, not 5 stars as indicated. The rooms are very dated and run down, old crappy beds and pillows, an old TV and overall poorly maintained. The whole property is pretty run down and old-looking. The food is subpar, not one meal I had would be called great. The service is uneven and the staff is poorly trained and uninformed. Many do not comprehend English. The beach is great, it's the only redeeming factor. However the resort is a 1-hour taxi trip from the airport.

<Content>Facilities need work!!! We visited Excellence for 5 nights in December. Our first room, #1112, had a safe that didn't work and so-so air conditioning. When we went to the front desk to complain, we were told to go to the room and someone would be there within 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, the safe guy showed up, but nobody for the A/C. The safe guy couldn't fix it. When he left, the electricity went out! It went out a second time before we finally went to the front desk to change rooms. We had dinner that night in the Lobster House. Don't waste your time on this one...the lobster tails had about 2 bites of food included. While we were in there, the electricity went out again!Room 3002 served us pretty well, until night #3 when my partner got up to go to the bathroom and stepped into an inch of water. A hose had broken on the back of the toilet and flooded our room. It would've been ok, but when we went to the front desk we were told that we needed to wait until noon to see if perhaps they could move us to another room. The front desk clerks weren't empowered to just move us. My partner was infuriated that they wanted us to wait 4 hours for a new room . Finally, Matias at the front desk finally arranged to have us moved to another upgraded room - 3109. We walked in and saw the leak coming from the ceiling and nearly flipped. We finally got into #3110, which was a gorgeous suite with a beautiful view. On the positive side, the food at the other restaurants was very good. I particularly liked the French restaurant, while my partner liked the Asian restaurant. The breakfast buffet was like nothing I'd ever seen before - LOTS of choices. The ocean was WAY too rough to enjoy, particularly if you're not a strong swimmer. Much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there, so if you're a big ocean fan, I don't recommend this resort. My favorite part, by far, though, were the beds next to the pools and ocean. They were AMAZING!!!! I guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks. All in all, a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour. It was worth every penny!

<Content>Excellence was exactly that! My family and I stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana from December 22 to December 29 of this year. It was an amazing time had by all that attended. We arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in Vancouver, but even at 4 am, the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par. Our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with. Check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes. I had never been to an all inclusive resort before, and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room, as well as the ample storage space for our things. Room service even at 4 am was great, the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food, which seemed a little long, but I think they only say that to cover there butts, because it took about 25 minutes at most. The activities during the day were well thought out, though, there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions (beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds.) The entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly, a special thanks to all my friends, Ines (my fiance,) Altagracia (who lovingly reffered to me as Flaco Loco, which translates into Crazy Skinny Guy,) Eliza and Johanna (my disco dance partners,) Sexy Cesar (who taught me all the sexy dance moves I now know,) Julio Cesar (the MC for the games and parties.) The restaurants I can't offer too much help with, I didn't eat at all of them, but of the few I did eat at, I recommend Toscana for the huge buffet everyday, breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious (although I don't recommend the scrambled eggs.) The omlettes are delicious and you HAVE to try one. For lunch, you have to check out the grill on the beach, different food everyday, always good, and makes the beach smell amazing. For dinner, I liked Spice ( asian cuisine,) Agave (mexican, but don't eat the calimari from here, very rubbery,) The pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome, make sure you try that. The bars were awesome, you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks, instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke, try the Brugal Extra Anejo, they call it the Dominican babymaker, and it's obvious why once you try it. The stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor. The disco is great too, although sometimes a little empty, but still worth checking out. The worst part of my trip was the vendors, they don't let up, and I am a very well mannered person, which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again, make sure you don't tell them you like anything until you know you're going to buy it, otherwise you'll have to beat them off with a stick to get away. Try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10pm every night, they are worth it. The ice breaker shows are fun too, it gets people into the swing of things. All in all, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half, there is not a very big single crowd, so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they're looking to party with other singles. Hope this helps you. Adios amigos and amigas.

<Content>Incredible!! My husband and I stayed here for six days on our honeymoon; it was the most incredible resort. The rooms were comfortable and lovely, and the service was impeccable. We were so impressed we are looking into the other Excellence resorts for our next vacation. We loved that it was all-inclusive; get hungry at 3 am? No problem, just call room service. The restaurants were impressive, and the bars were really nice; everything about the resort was visually appealing, clean, and luxurious. There were all sorts of things to do, also. We went horseback riding, spent a day in the spa (amazing!!), saw a circus and a magic show, and walked through the botanical garden, all within the resort. Most other places (Marinarium, Bavaro Tours) will pick you up right in front of the lobby if you want to do activities outside the resort. I definitely wouldn't rent a car, though, unless you are comfortable driving amongst maniacs. Not kidding.Seriously, though, if you are looking for a place to get away from everything, Excellence at Punta Cana is the perfect choice. Our honeymoon could not have been better.

<Content>They do not honor your reservations! For starters, Liberty Travel dropped the ball, failed to tell us that if we flew in to Santa Domingo Airport we would be facing a 4 -5 hour HORRIBLE ride over unpaved roads, since it was not the closest airport. The airport that is closest to Excellence is the Punta Cana Airport! We had to spend big $ to switch airports and airlines for our departure. Next, because we arrived so late, thanks to the long ride from the wrong airport, we were told that the room we paid for, which was partial oceanview, could not be honored, as they only had a courtyard/palm tree view available. Depressed and discouraged, we sucked it up until the next day, when they moved us to another courtyard/palm-tree room! As a compensation for this 5 day disaster, we were offered and accepted a dinner at the beach, even though all meals were paid for and inclusive. They actually told Liberty Travel that they felt that this was adequate compensation! In addition, the air conditioning in both rooms was not adequate, and sleeping was difficult. The first room had plumbing problems. When the toilet did not flush properly, and began to overflow, we called the plumber at 3 am. He kept us up for about an hour, working inside and outside the room. When we never heard from him again, we called the front desk, and told them not to send him back in, and that we would also deal with that problem on our own. Personally, I would NEVER go back to the Dominican Republic if I wanted an excellent vacation. It's still way too 3rd world, and has a lot of catching up to do. Don't try to use the river pool. Only a couple of brave souls entered in to it, since it was freezing. Spend a few more dollars, and go to Aruba.

<Content>Still great, afer 3 visits! We love everything about the place. Maybe we've been lucky as we've never had any problems with anything. All of the staff and activity people are super. Marosal ,Juan, Juan Carlos, Cesar are a few of the names I remember but they are all unbelievable. The drive is one hour from the airport and isn't too bad.The restaurants and the staff are terrific. Domingo the sax player is a real world -class musician and a must see and hear part of the package, his versions of Brazil, The Girl from Ipanema and Besame Mucho are unique and beautiful as well are his other songs! We will be back again. We met a lot of wonderful people from around the world . My wife and I enjoyed the food and drinks, we've been to a few other places over the years and Excellence is the best place we've been to....Charles and Nancy Lubanski

<Content>Excellence is Excelente! Just beware of the ocean! After 6 months I'm finally getting around to writing my review. I choose Excellence based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, and I was not disappointed. The 1+ hour ride from airport to resort was, hmmm, interesting. Our driver drove like a local on the narrow roads of the DR which added to the adventure, but was a tad frightening at points. We arrived at the resort and were pleasantly greeted at the front desk with cool towels and drinks. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our garden view room: well-appointed, good size, nice soaking tub, but we consistently had cold showers in the 4-6pm hours. Our room was at one end of the property, but was a fairly short and enjoyable walk to the main lobby area where the restaurants, etc. are situated. The staff is always friendly and accomodating and all replied to our greetings with the fun phrase Excelente! response. The pools are gorgeous! The swim up bar was tops (with top shelf liquor) with lots of friendly people from all over the US, Canada, and Europe. We always found a chair or bed available by the pool. The palapas provided well-needed shade but in the Dominican Republic in June it was difficult to walk the 2-3 feet (very short distance) from the chair to the pool without your feet burning! The restaurants were tops! We had an excellent, romantic dinner at Toscana  Spice (serenaded with Spanish Eyes by a mariache band at Spice), and a good (but not spectacular) meal at Chez Isabelle. We ate at Toscana for breakfast during our 5 day stay and never felt that it was the same thing each day as they had a good variety. The entertainment was pleasant, but not necessarily top quality. The dance club, Alegria, was relatively small and played mostly hip hop. My boyfriend and I are social ballroom and swing dancers and were unable to really find music that we could dance to romantically, which was disappointing, but not a deal killer. The beach was beautiful, but beware!!! Both my boyfriend and I are skilled swimmers who have swam at the Jersey shore (Atlantic ocean) for decades., We have both been in rough tides and know how strong the pull of the tide can be. Unfortunately, we got caught in a riptide when we swam out to a nearby sandbar and almost drowned!!! In the commotion, we forgot to swim parrallel to the shore when the riptide came in and we kept getting pulled out further and further. After going under the 3rd time, and feeling my boyfriend getting fatigued, I started to scream for help.... especially since I had seen a sign on the beach saying there were no lifeguards! After feeling like I was certainly going to drown on my birthday (June 8), a small-statured lifeguard (real lifeguard?) appeared with his boogie board, and rescued us. This was frightening, but we managed to put it behind us afterwards at the swim up bar. ;-) This is where we learned that a person had drowned off of the resort's beach in January 2008: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?messageID=13569407tstart=0 and http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2008/1/2/26571/Canadian-man-still-missing-off-Punta-Cana-coast . If swimming in the ocean is your main goal for your vacation, this is is not the place to go. If you are looking for a well run resort, plenty of places to sunbathe, with good food, no kids, and other romantics surrounding you, then choose Excellence Punta Cana.

<Content>Excellence blew me away! Spent five nights at the Excellence Punta Cana from December 21-26 2008. My only previous all inclusive stay in the Dominican was at the Bavaro Princess, and let me say, there really is no comparison.From the moment you arrive from the airport, you can sense the decadence. The resort grounds are in perfect shape, and the smaller size - at least by mega resort standards - makes getting around the resort simple. We were in room 3101, and quickly realized that upgrading to an Excellence Club, swim up, or ocean view room really isn't needed. That said, while spending most of our time at the Cascade Pool, we figured on a return trip a swim up room would be a nice indulgence.The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The minibar was stocked daily and very cold! The bed was firm as indicated in prior reviews, but that's exactly how I like it.We spent most days at the Cascade Pool, which is nice and has a secluded feeling. Never a problem getting a chair, towel or floatee. The beach was nice, and the waves made boogie boarding quite fun. And let me say, the absence of kids makes enjoying the pool and the beach that much easier.On to the food. What better way to start each morning than room service breakfast in bed? It was great not having to head down to the buffet in the morning. The room service was quick and tasty, and whenever I asked if I could customize my breakfast, the answer was, of course!.Now, I know that lots of people fret about the food in these resorts. Let me say, we LOVED it. Here is a quick synopsis of the food we tried:The Grill: Perhaps our favourite. Ate the grilled Mahi Mahi and the Mahi Mahi baguette for lunch most days, and instantly looked forward to it the next day. Perfect spot for lunch.Spice: Tried the grouper fillet on night one (a little salty) and the shrimp Pad Thai. Nothing like the Pad Thai we have at home, but delicious nonetheless. The seafood soup appetizer is also great, but I would skip the sushi next time around.Toscana: Very nice for dinner, but the lunch buffet was not my thing. I prefer to stay away from buffets whenever possible.Chez Isabelle: Wow! You really feel like you are in a 5* restaurant here. I had the Nicoise salad and the Sea Bass, and it was incredible.Lobster House: As others have pointed out, a bit of a letdown. Not bad, but not great either.As for the drinks, the selection of wine is impressive, and as all have said, the Coco Locos, served in a fresh coconut, are something I will be dreaming about for a while.We met several couples that have been going to the EPC for years and it is easy to see why. After our trip to the Bavaro Princess we were eager to see what other resorts have to offer - that curiosity is now gone - ALL future trips to the Dominican will be for return visits to the Excellence Punta Cana - a true first class resort!

<Content>Best Hotel in the Dominican It was our 4th time to the Domincan, this hotel was by far a superior class. Resort: A very private resort where noise is kept to a minimum as it is chidren free and geared towards adults. Plently of places to relax so it is not over-crowded. There were lots of different seating ranging from loungers to four poster beds both on the beach and around the pool, with plently of towels. The reception is large and spacious and very comfortable. The reception staff are very helpful, especially charismatic Edwin. The unique design of the resort means that you don't get wet walking from the rooms to the restaurants during the tropical showers.Rooms: There was a 4 poster bed, luxury furnishings and it was very comfortable. Well maintained and clean. It was a spacious room with good seperate shower. DVD players in the room. The TV channels are limited and very geared towards the US market, no English footie or news.Facilities: There is waiter service wherever you lay your hat. They will take drinks orders as well as deliver pizza on the beach. There are 8 restaurants for the evening dinners to satisfy most taste buds. If you have any special food requirements e.g. vegetarian, see Ramon, manager of Barcelona restaurant, he will make anything for you. (Thank you Ramon, you made our holiday). The head chef, Mr Dettweitler is world renown and ensures that all of the food is of the highest quality, they are very lucky to have him there. The breakfast and lunch buffets are fantastic offering a large choice of food. Felix the manager of the Toscana is very polite and helpful. The gym is the most modern we have ever seen in a hotel with state of the art equipment and it is well maintained.General: They create a very comfortable atmosphere and nobody violates your space in any way, but they are always there if you need them. It is a very easy place to settle in to. Go for it, you will not be disappointed! Mr and Mrs Dhillon

<Content>Great service, nice hotel, mediocre food... My husband and I stayed at Excellence for five nights mid-November. We booked our trip at the very last minute so we weren't able to do a ton of research on the Dominican but the hotel receives high ratings thorughout the web. After the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met. I have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us. We opted to upgrade to the Excellence Club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not. As part of the Excellence Club, you are ushered to the club's private lobby for check-in but, really, it almost just creates an unneccesary step in the check-in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip. The biggest benefits of the Excellence Club for us were the unlimited internet access, beach towels in the room (they were hard to get otherwise), and the beach bag in our room. We did eat breakfast each morning in the Excellence Club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you didn't have to deal with a crowd. The hotel itself was clean, the staff was very friendly, and nothing ever felt crowded. However, the food wasn't great. It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great. I'm not a big eater but I was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just wasn't anything I was crazy about. The presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland. I think that is the best way to describe it. The pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive. We went on two excursions - swimming with the sting-rays/sharks and the zip-line tour. We loved the zip-line excursion. The staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great. It was interesting to visit the sting-rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing. The fish were very small and there wasn't much to see. The electricity went out in our room a handful of times, especially when I used the hairdryer. Also, our AC was terrible. They tried to repair it but it just never got cool. Our room was big, though, and clean. We always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini-bar daily. In many of the reviews, people said they got sick. Our representative at the hotel (through AAA) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they don't realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it. Coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption. I would still pack the Immodium just to be sure. I couldn't decide if I wanted to give this hotel a 3/5 or a 4/5 but I decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room. I don't think I would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there. We met a lot of great people at the swim up bar!

<Content>Our trip Our trip to the Dominican Republic was okay. We stayed at the Excellence Resort. It would have been excellent if we didn't have so many problems getting the service that we paid for. When we called to get something fixed like the leaking ceiling or the toliet that stopped working, it took forever. Numerous times there was not any towels for the next day or the mini bar was not restocked with the things that we liked. The thing that saved the trip was the entertainment staff. They were always smiling and asking if you were having a good time. They got you involved in the activities that were going on like dancing and spanish lessons. Also, they had really good shows that were funny and entertaining. Juan Carlos, Cesar and all the girls there were excellent. I think that it is very beautiful and relaxing there but I would definately let my friends know about the advantages and disadvantages of my trip and let them decide of they would want to go.

<Content>Peace, quiet, and good food We spent a week at the Excellence Punta Cana - our fifth visit to the D.R. This is the best hotel we have found so far. Rooms are the usual junior suites, well-supplied. The pool is great. Staff were friendly and helpful. The beach is wide. Surf was a bit rough (we did have some rain each day - not enough to make us stay inside) but there were calm areas too. The big difference was the food - the best we have eaten in the Caribbean so far. You can avoid a buffet for all three meals if you prefer and there are no dinner buffets at all. This is a big plus. The food is nicely prepared and presented. Our one complaint was sand fleas, but this likely had more to do with the weather than anything else. We will consider a return to the Excellence for certain. Because we went a bit before high season began, we enjoyed peace and quiet - a lovely rest - and of course the good food.

<Content>Can't Wait to Go Back! We had the best time at Excellence! My wife and I went there for our honeymoon for a week long stay from 11/09-11/16. We never thought we would be the type to return to a place because we love to travel all over, but we have decided to return to Excellence Punta Cana for one or more of our anniversaries.First of all, the resort, beach and surroundings are all beautiful. It was truly like being immersed in a paradise. Our room was a deluxe garden view on the first floor and we experienced no problems with the room. It had it's own little patio and private hammock. After reading many reviews before arriving we were very suprised at how harsh people can critize the most miniscule imperfections.We read that quite a few people complained that the air conditioning wouldn't work unless the patio door was latched. Really? That's your complaint? The food also gets a bad rap, but is actually quite good. The fact that there is so much of a variety and that it is all inclusive really makes it easy to find something that is tasty. The breakfast buffet was great; it was such a huge spread. Our favorite meal however, was at the beach party. The staff set up a beautiful area and prepared a bunch of traditional Dominican food. It was events like these that we enjoyed so much. We'd like to thank the entertainment staff for all that they did. Hooray for Cesar, Santo, Eliza, Mariel, and Ines! They worked the whole day specifically to make sure everyone had a great time and we enjoyed their company and enthusiasm.It was great that each night, we would have a schedule slipped under the door for the upcoming day. We could plan our day around a lot of fun activities: beach volleyball, pool volleyball, beach olympics, dancing lessons, etc...This schedule also gives you a lot of important info like the restaurant schedule and the show at night. We ended up seeing the show almost every night. The Michael Jackson show was the best and the Circus show was impressive as well. Based on our experiences I'd like to offer some suggestions:1.Try all the drinks! Our favorites were the Dirty Banana, the Coco Loco and the Sammy Sosa. 2. If you know Spanish, use as much as you can. It really goes a long way with the staff. Tips aren't expected but are certainly appreciated. A couple bucks to the maids ensures that your room will be taken care of nicely, with a few suprises even. One night we returned from the show, to have a bubble bath drawn with rose petals, and candles everywhere. Nice! We couldn't believe how nasty some other guests are to the staff. while these workers bust there butts all day. If you are nice to the staff, you will get great service. 3. We did purchase one excursion; a boat trip swimming with sharks and Sting rays. It was pretty touristy, but pretty fun. A non-resort excursion isn't necessary; there's plenty to do if you stay on the property.4. Just outside the property, vendors set up and and are pretty ruthless. It's not to hard to get past them, ignoring them seems to be the best bet. 5. Take the complaints in other reviews with a grain of salt. We've traveled all over; through Europe, Japan, Thailand and more, but Excellence has been the best by far. Have Fun, Jake and Heather.

<Content>Very Relaxing Experience Just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband. This was our first time in the Dominican Republic, and we have literally been to every single island in the Caribbean. So I can assure you that my review will be short, sweet, and comprehensive. In general, we liked the DR, and the Excellence was very nice. The top reasons why we liked Excellence were: 1) NO KIDS (ie., if I want to get away from my own kids, I definitely don't want to vacation with other peoples' kids). It was so quiet!2) The staff and the people in the DR in general. So genuinely friendly, helpful, and wonderful. Great dispositions. Believe me, this is NOT true in most other areas of the Caribbean.3) The all-inclusive feature. Loved being served, served, served. I wanted to sit on my [--] all day and just be a gluttonous pig...and this is the perfect place to do it. 4) The best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs, beds, and hammocks I've ever seen. There were palapas everywhere, so there was no shortage of shade. There were so many beds, you didn't have to worry about not getting one. I'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed, because usually hotels have only a few, so you end up looking longingly at the lucky few who get them. Not here - almost everyone can have one if they wish.OK, so here's what I didn't love about Excellence:1) Beach is not swimmable. Way too rough most of the time. For this reason alone, I'd not return here. I'm a beach fan, and love to swim in the warm Caribbean sea. You just can't do it here.2) Food. I'm no food snob, but some of the food was downright bad. And you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch. Even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner. We only stayed 4 nights, and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast/lunch selection by the 3rd day...Overall, if you just want to relax by the pool and you don't care about not going in the beach, this is a very beautiful resort. The staff is wonderful. If you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy, this isn't your place.

<Content>5-Star Views......2-Star Service I don't know where to start. The roaches in the room, the rude waiters, bartenders, front desk, the dead flies that stayed on our friends' mirror the entire stay, the average at best food (only one morning in the bathroom for longer than you would want), the 6,7,8 times I had to trip the breakers so my wife could use the hair dryer without our power going out, or the waste of money the excellence club turned out to be......I guess I'll start with the good.The beach was fabulous. The resort itself, d茅cor, pool, beach access was great.OK now for the rest of the trip.We booked the Excellence after changing from another resort we booked. We booked the other one a little quickly and then read some really bad reviews. So we were able to get out of that one and do a little more homework. We read about the Excellence from Trip Advisor and were really excited to go. Now, we've been to the Caribbean plenty and are low maintenance travelers. We'll check in and the hotel usually doesn't hear from us until we leave. One thing we usually like to do is get to the front desk and see about upgrading rooms. We were originally booked in a garden view room. Our first question at the front desk was, 鈥渄o you have any ocean view rooms available?鈥?He said, 鈥淵es, let me tell you about the excellence club.鈥?The excellence club rooms are identical to every other room in the resort (but with a plasma TV) and you have access to what鈥檚 basically another room where you can eat (the same food that鈥檚 served everywhere else), have premium drinks, and check out DVDs. He showed us where we would be staying. It was perfect, right in front of the pool over looking the ocean. Much to our dismay, we show up and still have a garden view. We call the front desk and ask where the ocean view room is and he commences to telling us how wonderful the excellence club is. So great, the hustle is on. After spending much of the first night arguing back and forth while he鈥檚 鈥渓ooking into it鈥?we finally gave up and waited until the morning. They finally moved us to a pool front room but I still don鈥檛 why we had to pay $400 extra per couple for a plasma TV and movies. The movies ended up being ok since one morning I stayed in bed with an upset stomach and my wife did the same thing a couple of nights.The resort was pretty much empty so we were a little confused why there were no ocean front rooms available. The restaurants were empty, the bars were empty. Where is everyone? I guess enjoying their ocean front rooms. Another strange phenomenon was with it being so empty, why were the waits so long? Waiting for service, waiting for a table, waiting for a drink, waiting at the front desk. The place was empty! There were a few nice waiters but most of them were rude, acted as if we were bothering them and sometimes just stood there and looked at us like we were stupid or something.I was amazed. I would recommend bringing an electrician with you as well because you鈥檒l need to get the power turned on if you want to dry your hair and run the air conditioner at the same time. Watch your step walking underneath the vent as well so you won鈥檛 slip in the leaking water from the vent. We had roaches in our bar, the couple that went with us noticed dead flies stuck to their mirror in clear sight and they stayed there the whole time we were there.The food? Average at best. The quality wasn鈥檛 very good. We spent the whole trip scared of it after we were in the bathroom the next morning. We called room service one night and they were out of pepperonis for the pizza. (That was more funny than annoying) And our friends went to the Italian restaurant and ate dinner. After, they ordered dessert: 鈥淲e鈥檙e out of tiramisu.鈥?OK, what do you have? 鈥淲e have one cheesecake鈥?OK, what kind? 鈥淣O, we have one piece of cheesecake left.鈥?Unbelievable. Ran out of dessert! Like I said before, we鈥檙e low maintenance travelers. We go to a cheaper place and have to wait or deal with annoyances, we don鈥檛 mind. You get what you pay for. But this is supposed to be a 4-5 star establishment and it seemed as though they didn鈥檛 know what the heck they were doing.It was just a comedy of issues from the time we showed up to the time we left. The whole trip was ruined and that鈥檚 a few thousand dollars we wish we had back. There are so many other options available down there, look elsewhere. I know we鈥檒l never return.

<Content>Loved everything Had a great holiday, everthing about this hotel was brilliant, rooms, food, set up of the hotel, entertainment was great, all the staff were so friendly and helpful especially Cesar. will be back soon.The only little thing is they tell you about a dress code for the evenings and not everyone takes notice and nothing gets said, people should make the effort and if they don't then be asked too as it says in the rules.

<Content>Great pool The best restaurants would be Chez isabelle, Agave, Spice and the grill. The rooms were nice. The pool spans across the resort and everything is within close walking distance. The entertainment was fun and above average compared to any other resort I've been to. The best excursions would be 4wheeling and Macao Beach. Saona Island is nice too. If you want to buy souvenirs, walk left to the resort to go to Nancy's. She's very friendly and her prices are reasonable. The water is a bit rough if you expect to swim in it.

<Content>Great Adults Only Resort This is a great place for a couple to spend quality time together. The grounds and acommodations are Excelente. We found the food somewhat inconsistent through out the 8 restaurants. Good were Chez Isabelle (French), The Grill (Meats), Agave (Mexican) and Spice (Asian). Others not bad, but not so good. Breakfast and lunches were very good to excellent. The people there are very friendly and willing to help in most cases. Found pool and beach service quality somewhat sporadic. They sometimes forget to bring you what you order.Overall service was very good.We found the entertainment to be enjoyable every night. We love to dance, but found the DJ at the Disco to play stuff he liked instead of what the guests could dance to. We still enjoyed the music.We will not hesitate to go back, and will probably do so next year.

<Content>Romantic Getaway Dec 2008 My boyfriend and I stayed at Excellence from Dec 6-13th. We called to confirm our reservation a week before our trip and when we were asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, my boyfriend said it was our anniversary. (not a complete lie, our anniversary was two months ago! LOL) I'd recommend doing this because we got champagne when we arrived, a romantic dinner at one of the restaurants with rose petals on the table and a bottle of champagne, a jacuzzi filled with bubbles and flower petals one night after returning to our room, 15% off at the spa, etc. Just a lot of romantic extras that I don't believe the average person gets.We arranged a private taxi through the hotel to pick us up, and as soon as we got in the car, the driver took out a cooler with ice cold beers inside for us!! That was a GREAT first impression! We relaxed for our 1 hour ride to the hotel, the roads are bad yes, but nothing that should deter you from going on the trip.The service was amazing everywhere. The staff really is wonderful. They serve you pizzas on the beach and by the pool every day, have cookouts on the beach, the drinks keep flowing all day, they even refill your glasses at the restaurants before they're even empty! Our room was perfect (room 11209) It had a vaulted ceiling because it was on the third floor, and a beautiful garden view. The maids were great, they mop every day since we track in a lot of sand, etc. we tipped them $2 a day and then $5 the last day.I did get sick about our third day there, not really sure from what, but we brought ammodium so it was under control, but the next two or three days i couldn't eat much was a little nauseous and worried about getting worse. The food is my only complaint really. It's not bad but i just thought it would be better since everything else there is so perfect. I'm sure you'll find something you like at every restaurant, but i'd say it's just average. It would be the only reason i'd think twice about going back, but mostly because i got sick, not because of the food itself.We did the free horseback riding on the beach (kinda scary as my horse was slow and clumsy and they kept whipping him to go faster which scared me! lol I was a first time rider and kept thinking i was going to fall off ) We also did the ziplining excursion which we LOVED. Highly recommend it. Wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. Very fun.We also did Saona Island which was nice, we had some rain on and off though but overall not bad. The island was very pretty and the food they served there was pretty good. The beach isn't as bad as they say it is. You can't swim around alot but it's fun to play in the waves and the water it a beautiful color. It's true that if you walk to the right around the corner you'll find calmer water where you CAN swim with no waves. Too sandy for snorkeling though, but it was very nice and a little secluded.We only went to Nancy at the shops on the beach. She's so nice and her english is perfect (she seems americanized) and she lets you browse on your own, which is a nice change from being followed and harrassed to buy things. We bought a bottle of rum, 3 cigars, a bathing suit wrap, kids tshirt, small framed painting and prob one or two other things I can't think of all for $55. They don't negotiate their prices there, but wasn't really a problem because they were fair to begin with.We found a jacuzzi one night by the pool with a tray next to it with flowers and a bottle of champagne. We asked someone if it had been reserved and they said no that's for anyone. It was those little details like that that really go to me. It is such a beautiful and romantic place. I would definately recommend it, as long as you're not too picky an eater, and you bring some ammodium or pepto.Domingo, the sax player, plays so beautifully. Really helps set the romantic mood. The shows were hit or miss. The perfect couple and the circus were both great! Chris Blizzard and the magic show put us to sleep a little, and we missed the michael jackson show but heard from other people who saw it that it was very good.We heard the club was corny so we didn't go there, we were back at the room by 11-12 everynight anyway since we were tired from the long day. We paid extra for the dinner on the beach, which is well worth the money. It was so romantic, and the food was the best we had all week!The first few nights I didn't get bitten so i didn't wear the bug spray i brought but then i did get 5-10 mosquito bites on my legs the second half of the week so i'd recommend wearing the spray. I'd give the resort 4.5 stars and the food 3 stars. Feel free to write me with any questions.

<Content>Excellante! We just got back yesterday from a one week stay at the Excellence Resort in Punta Cana. I had done my research online and found that with the exception of the food, there were almost 100% positive things that people had to say about this resort. It all lived up to be true. The resort was magical. My wife and I went with 2 friends of ours and were blown away. The pool and beach were spectacular. As tropical beach rooms go, the rooms were nicely appointed with an open feel. Bathtub in the room, shower in the bathroom, was a nice tough. The only negative thing I can say about this experience was the food. Even though at all the restaurants you ordered from menus, the food was prepared banquet style. What I mean by this is that it was not as hot and fresh as food would typically be that is prepared for you. If you are a person that typically eats in nice restaurants in cities like New York, San Francisco, etc... you will probably rate this food around a C+ or B-. Though I am not typically a buffet type person, I would highly recommend you go to their buffet for both Breakfast and Lunch. You will not be disappointed as they will prepare eggs, meats, pastas individually for you. Lastly on the food, steer clear of the Lobster House. It was the only restaurant that highly disappointed us. Every place else (the mexican, french, italian, etc..) provided the ambiance, a decent meal, wine, etc... for a very nice evening. Outside of the food, the resort and its people were truly amazing. We will definitely go back!This review was written by an ad agency executive who travels almost half the year in mostly big cities like LA, New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco. I am lucky enough to entertain clients in very fine restaurants and would probably be considered a food snob.

<Content>Absolute Paradise...Life doesn't get better than this!!!!! My husband and I stayed at Excellence Punta Cana from 10th Nov - 24th Nov. This was our first holiday in 2 years, so we were looking for somewhere where we can just relax on a beautiful beach or by the pool. We didn't expect much with regards to the food after having read poor reviews and to be honest some of them had us a little worried. I am pleased to say that Excellence Punta Cana exceeded our expectations by a mile!!!! For the first couple of day, I just walked around with my mouth open...the place is absolutely breathtaking. We loved our room (3101), clean, spacious and quiet. The beach is beautiful, the sea is so much fun to swim in (we both like the waves!), the pool is huge and sparkling clean with plenty of beds/loungers. The food...WOW...as I said we didn't expect much and we're not sure why people are complaining so much (bearing in mind that we are very fussy eaters)! For a start it is an all-inclusive resort not a Michelin-star Restaurant. The choices were plentiful and the food was fresh, well presented and well cooked. We were there for 2 weeks and could have probably stayed another 2 weeks without getting bored of the food. The entertainment team do a great job, the bar staff are fun, beach  pool servers always around, the waiting staff friendly and attentive, the housekeeping ladies kept our room spotlessly clean and tidy. I'm not going to single out any staff in particular because I think every single one played a big part in having made our stay so enjoyable, and in particular those behind the scenes who works so hard but don't get the tips or the credit they derserve! We've had a wonderful time and although we usually prefer not to return to the same place (so as not to spoil it), Excellence Punta Cana is one of those places that we would certainly not hesitate going back to...in fact we would have quite liked to move in!There are so much more to say, but I could go on forever...it all comes down to the same...this place is a taste of heaven, go with the right attitude and you will not be dissapointed! Everything that they offer must surely satisfy 90% of guests...as for the other 10%, there is no satisfaction no matter what you do...they should probably rather stay at home and certainly not travel to a 3rd world country!PS: 1. Enjoy the ride from the airport (50minutes), its an excursion on its own, saves having to pay to go on one in precious holiday time. 2. Find the Soft Serve Machine by Cafe Kafe Bar.3. Nancy's shop is the best, she won't rip you off! (With the other vendors everything always starts at $200, and you can get it down to $15, Nancy gives a reasonable price from the start)4. Go to the Sports bar for ice cold water!

<Content>Everything is Excellent at Excellence Punta Cana We just got back from our honeymoon. We had an amazing time at Excellence Punta Cana. We felt we were in paradise. The hotel and service was excellent. The whole staff was very friendly and so polite. My husband and I didn't want to leave the resort. They made us feel very special. We have never experience a trip like this one. We loved it so much we are gathering a group of couple to go again early next summer. We never experience a problem while our stay. All of our belongings we safe, nothing was missing. Can't wait to go back. Much love to Maria Isabel and Carlos from Excellence Club Concierge-- From Mr. and Mrs. Zamora 12-09

<Content>Turk, I'm Dominican! Food...Will add photos later but we ate everywhere EXCEPT Oregano, Agave, The Grill and The Lobster House. Ate at Spice twice and everything we got was delicious. Greek salad was superb at Toscana for lunch and at the Med. food for dinner. Everything was excellent. Room service was just average. The Three Milk Cake is a hidden gem on that menu. Room service menus listed beverages they would not bring. A couple of days we opted not to have our mini fridge filled and room service didn't want to bring any drinks except breakfast time. We used room service A LOT and pretty much always had our meals within thirty minutes but always definately under an hour and near their estimated time. Loved the beach pizza!! That's what I called the pizza they bring around the pools around 1 every day. Delicious!! Grounds...Everything was so nice and clean and the hotel is the perfect size and makes the grounds easily accessible. Everything is very well kept. Everyone always has a smile to offer.Rooms...The mattress is firm but I loved it. The tub was amazing! Our jets were broke the first night and we told the front desk. When we got in it the third night we fully expected them to still not work from reading reviews but they did! So they had been fixed immediately after reporting a problem. The maidservice is fantastic overall. We did not get service twice a day every day and this was a little disappointing. But everything was cleaned well every day and she was always polite. A little Spanish will get you a long way when communicating needs. The rooms are very spacious and I loved all the little attention to details. Our room did have DVD player in it in case you want to bring a couple movies, which might be a good idea for bad weather.Beach....Beautiful. Yes, go right for calmer ocean and seclusion. Very romantic! Overall very rough waves though. Not the blue you might expect from Carribean. Loved the beds! The excellence club area has the best ones. Pools...The main looks amazing! It goes on forever and looks so much fun. But we were Cascade Pool folk and it was a more intimate one where you were bound to see the same people throughout the week. They are all very well kept and clean. Never a problem with rafts. Towels aren't usually a problem til afternoon but most people seemed to have one by then anyway.Entertainment/Activities...Everything we saw was great and fun. If you want to have fun, you can. We didn't do any of the activities.Service...EXCELLENT! If you said just casually that you wanted something and it was at all in the power of the person whom you were speaking with's ability to get it for you they would run (often literally!) to go get it for you. This happed to us on numerous occasions. The staff seem to sincerely want you to have the best vacation you've ever had. The Dominican people are so hospitable and generous and sweet. They truly made it a pleasureable destination. They made the trip every second in everything they did. Also, tipping. It is never expected but always appreciated. Other...Yes, we got sick. not til the 5th day though! My husband had a fever of 101-104 for about 18 hours before we went to the hospital (about 50 minutes away). ALWAYS BUY TRAVEL INSURANCE!! If you have any questions about our medical care at the hotel or hospital feel free to PM me. But he did get diahrea as well and me too but after still being sick a week after I got back I went to the doctor here and my labs were fine. Mine was probably stress and the meds they gave him cleared him up. But it should probably be mentioned he got sick there. Drinks were all amazing. Loved me some Sol Dominicanos!It is definately not necessary to know Spanish, but it might be helpful to learn a little. If you would have to go from the resort at all it is helpful. I would advise learning a little but not necessary.Thanks to past traveler recommending power strip!I would bring an old sheet for the beach/pool beds. On the chance you don't get a towel you can lay that down instead for both of you. Also, it's good to lay down anyway if you have towels. Also, know that if you do go to the vendors on the beach be careful what you say/do. Just saying I liked a painting got us in an uncomfortable situation with a lot of pressure to spend money we literally did not have with us. If you are thinking about it at all, go! I think we might have had a worst-case type of scenario and I'm still recommending it. It was paradise for the couple wanting to just get away together. Thanks again to all the staff and friends we made!

<Content>Fantastic!!!! I stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana with my mother. It was a beautiful place! Mostly couples, but it was fine for the 2 of us as well. All the staff was wonderful and so accomodating. They offered a free 1/2 hour horse back ride on the beach which was awesome! The food was delicious! The dancers, especially Cesar, were wonderful! He even showed us how to salsa! It was such a wonderful trip I may even go back for my honeymoon!

<Content>The pool and beach were beautiful This hotel catered to every persons needs. I love the fact that it is all inclusive food and alcohol. Just because the hotel says it is all inclusive does not mean you dont have to tip. The people there work 12 days straight with 2 days off. They work up to 16 hours a day to make your experience there comfortable. So I made sure I tipped everyone who helped me. It is 35 pesos to one american dollar so you can do the math. The people that work in entertainment, Cesar, Mariel, Ines, Whinny were all very good. They taught me and my husband many things about there culture such as dancing. Also there was a bartender named Juan who made the best drinks there.

<Content>Signs of aging but full of beauty and surprises OVERALL (My Rating: 8 of 10)The Excellence Punta Cana: Like a mature lover, showing signs of age, but full of beautiful experience and surprises. This is an excellent (no pun intended) resort. There are several areas in need of refurbishment. However, the activities are plentiful, the staff is extraordinarily gracious, the food (in some restaurants) was superb, and the pool was so fabulous that even this workaholic found himself relaxing in no time. BACKGROUNDMy wife and I spent our wedding anniversary at the Excellence Punta Cana from Saturday, November 29 through Friday, December 5. We were looking for an all-inclusive island getaway. Beau Nanni at The Road Less Travelled suggested that because it was an anniversary vacation that we consider the adults-only Excellence Punta Cana. We finalized our decision only after reading the traveler reviews here at TripAdvisor and being pleased with the quoted price relative to most all-inclusive of a similar nature.AIRPORT TRANSFERPrieto Tours managed our transportation to and from the Excellence. The ride to and from the resort takes approximately 75-85 minutes. The roads in Punta Cana range from three-car-lengths wide, paved, and lined (near the airport) to one-car-length wide, unpaved, and unlined. Our driver slowed down considerably and coasted slowly over the divots and rocky patches. For those with motion sickness or anxiety, I might suggest an antiemetic (e.g., bonine/Dramamine). I had taken something anyway (because of the flight) so I found the ride from the airport to be more psychologically jarring (relative to suburban American infrastructure) than physically jarring.WEATHERThe weather was perfect with the low never falling below 72F/22C and the high never climbing above 85F/29C. There were brief sunrise showers on 3 of 7 mornings and a brief evening shower on 2 of 7 nights. Aside from that, the humidity was moderate and the breeze off the ocean was delightful particularly during the sunny early afternoons when sunbathing. Mosquitoes were not an issue during our stay. However, your experience may differ and I would suggest coming prepared with at least 1 small (1 fl.oz or 30 ml) bottle per person of 100% DEET per person per week.ACCOMMODATIONS (My Rating: 7 of 10)We had an ocean view from our Excellence Club Building 10 second floor room. Our view of the ocean was good, but not spectacular as the rooms are not actually that close to the ocean; the main pool and palm tree foliage sat between our room and the ocean. However, after reviewing the layout of the hotel, I surmise that our ocean view was probably one of the best. Our room had a beautiful ancient indigenous design, spacious, and comfortable. Other reviewers noted an ant and mosquito problem. We had no flying insects in our room. We did notice approximately 0-2 ants per day on the bathroom floor. Nothing of concern. The room furniture was adequate and the safe was large (not laptop large but 2 portable DVD players large). The balcony furniture was a nice luxury especially in the early morning and the evening. Our balcony screen door was broken upon our arrival, they fixed it within hours of my calling down.HOUSEKEEPING (My Rating: 4 of 10)The minibar was stocked and restocked daily. One day I left a note and a tip with a special request that was granted with friendly reply note. Daily room cleaning was inconsistent with regard to timing and quality. There was more than one occasion when I had to call down for an extra face cloth or towel to be delivered during the evening turn down service.BEACH (My Rating: 6 of 10)Soft luxurious sand, plenty of beach chairs, special cabanas (if you could get their early), beautiful water and BIG waves. It is an idyllic beach for watching the tide roll in and reading a book, but the waves were too strong and too big for any swimming or deep frolicking. FYI. Don't go too far pass the end of the resort on the side furthest from the lobby. Once you go 100 meters past Nancy's market, you're on your own because there are no more resorts or hotel on the beach in that direction for miles. If you want to explore the beach beyond the Excellence go the other direction (past the Excursions/Water Sports hut).MAIN SWIMMING POOL (My Rating: 10 of 10)There are two pools, but I only spent time at the main pool. The main pool is in a word fun. There are three bars between the plaza/ beginning of the pool and the end of the pool. There are plenty of beach chairs, two-person cabanas, and floating mats with drink holders. The water was fine, but I spent most of my time by the pool reading, resting, and taking full advantage of the pool waiter service. Someone came by to ask if I wanted a drink at least once every 60 minutes and between 1 PM and 3:30 PM, there is a waiter who walks around with hot pizza delivery. If they had someone from 9AM - 11 AM delivering donuts, I would have been in heaven.ACTIVITIES AND ENTERTAINMENT (My Rating: 8 of 10)Daily: Bike tours, horseback riding (free 30 min per guest per stay), Yoga, Aerobics, Spanish lessons, Diving lessons, Volleyball, Water polo, and more.Nightly: Live music, shows, theme dance partiesSuggested highlights: Saxophone player, Featured Music and Dance Performances (e.g., Rewind 70s and 80s and Michael Jackson Shows). The Michael Jackson show is silly (especially the pre-show) and the song selection is weak largely because Dangerous is simply Jam and Smooth Criminal remixed together and since they feature all three songs it feels monotonous but aside from that the Michael Jackson show is too kitschy to miss.SPA, GYM, and SPORTS (My Rating: 8 of 10) The spa (located between the mini market and the disco) is around the corner from the gym, tennis courts, basketball court, shooting range, archery range, and sports bar with billiard tables, foosball, darts, and ping pong. My wife partook of the spa on several occasions and was very impressed with the facility. There are different spa specials every day. You can find the spa specials list at the spa. Pick up a price list and the weekly specials list on day one so you can plan ahead your spa bookings. The gym has state-of-the-art new equipment, full nautilus, free-weights, four treadmills, and several bikes and step-machines. The music is pumping, the closed captioning is on the televisions and there is a personal trainer there available for many of the prime hours during the day. The gym is spacious, well-kept, staffed, and smells wonderful (which is unusual for a gym). I love working out and I loved that gym. The tennis courts (2 caliche-clay and 1 hard) and basketball court are in excellent shape. However, the other sport facilities were in various states of disrepair. One ping-pong table was good and the other was miserable. One pool-table was okay and the other was miserable. The upkeep of the sports and activity facilities, tables and equipment around the Sports Bar are in desperate need of renovations. The best surprise of the trip for me was the tennis facility and Rolando, the tennis pro. I play tennis regularly and have played (albeit poorly) in local leagues. I have received tennis instructor from at least 6 different instructors in my life time. Rolando was by far the best (even with the language difference). Rolando was 1/3 the cost of private 1 hour lessons in my area (however I live in a wealthy suburb between New York and Philadelphia) and was better then all of them. I learned more and had more fun working with Rolando in three days than I have with any instruction I've had in the last three years. If you play tennis and want to hit with a pro while you're there, find ROLANDO, and he has the newest top of the line Prince racquets for you to borrow.FOOD (My Rating: 7 of 10)Barcelona (Mediterranean/Spanish), Chez Isabelle (French), The Agave (Mexican), Toscano (Finer Italian), Spice (Chinese/Japanese/Thai), Lobster House (Just Lobster), The Grill (Steakhouse), Oregano (Common Italian - Pizza and Pasta). You know they take their service seriously when you see the staff line up at 6 AM for instructions. Tastes vary and with that caveat....The Agave was excellent Mexican fare in a quiet understated environment. Try the Tres Leche you won't be disappointed. Spice has the most fabulous decor and wonderful Asian dining choices. For those on their anniversary or honeymoon, when you go to the concierge to book your romantic dinner, I suggest Spice. The Spice Romantic dinner menu was a phenomenal range of courses seemingly even better than what was on the main menu (TIP: along with each course offering, order the two different entr茅es and share if you both don't have an overwhelming preference for one of the two entree choices). The Lobster House has only lobster so you had better like Lobster and why would you go to the Lobster House for breakfast... we did... bad idea. The Grill was unimpressive. Both the Lobster House and the Grill are outside near the pool, if the flying insects are out, good luck. The Toscano breakfast and lunch buffet were nothing to write home about, but they were solid, no complaints. (P.S. Excellence Club Members: sometimes the lounge seemed to have the best menu, so be sure to stop by the lounge before going to breakfast, lunch, or dinner)VENDORS:On Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays vendors come to the plaza between the beach and the lobby to sell their wares. You can find many of these same items (and often of slightly better quality) at the gift shop on the premises, however your bargaining power at the gift shop is limited. When the vendors come, it is time to make a deal. I'd suggest going to the gift shop to get a sense of what the standard market value is for items. Now take 10% off that price for gift shop overhead and that is your max price to pay for a similar item with the vendors. If you don't have any comparison, wait for the vendor to offer a price. Odds are a fair price is half that and a good bargain is 1/3 what the vendor offered. You can probably get a steal (i.e., a little more than break-even) if you're the first buy of the day, it is good luck for them to get that first sale. If you pay in $US get $US in return. Dominican pesos are worth a lot less than the $US.EXCELLENCE CLUBWe paid extra for the Excellence Club (for more details on the amenities of the Excellence Club and price differences please see the Excellence web site). We did not come close to taking advantage of the Excellence Club amenities and I probably wouldn't do it again. However, there are two things that made it worth all the alcohol we didn't drink from the minibar: (1) the private concierge service and check-in/check-out staff were EXTRAORDINARY, especially Carlos, who answered all of our big and little questions with a superb level of concern and joyous authenticity and (2) peace of mind: just knowing that if the weather were bad that we had food, PCs with internet service, big flat screen cinema tv, free movie rentals, etc. I think the Excellence Club is worth the upgrade if you know you're going to have bad weather or you just like having first-class perks.SUMMARY (My Rating: 8 of 10)PROS: The staff was extraordinarily gracious and welcoming. The pool and pool waiter service was magnificent. Tennis Pro Rolando.CONS: SportsBar area gaming facilities and equipment in poor shape. Inconsistent housekeeping. Distance/trip from airport. I would definitely recommend it for honeymooners and those on their anniversary. I would also recommend it for a group of seasoned singles or couples looking to get away as a group to an adults-only all- inclusive resort. If you're in the Excellence Club give a super excellente greeting to Carlos and if you play tennis, find ROLANDO as soon as you get there. His prime times book up fast, because people come there just to work with him.

<Content>Excellence high standards as usual My wife and I stayed at EPC for 14 nights from 17 November to 01 December 2008. We had a pool view room in Building 2 on the first floor, overlooking the 2 pools with cascade waterfall.Other reviews of this hotel have provided all the information which people should need to assist in their choice, so the purpose of this review is to provide some personal thoughts and impressions about the resort and how we found it for our tastes. We also include some notes of comparison with the two Mexico Excellence resorts which are very similar, but more modern.I have added, at the end, some notes about Punta Cana airport for those who are traveling to the Dominican Republic for the first time.The transfer to and from the airport took about 75 minutes. In both directions we were transported by VIP travel and the vehicles were modern, clean and air conditioned.It was unfortunate that on arrival, a group of 8 people who were scheduled to travel on our minibus, didn鈥檛 turn up and we waited an hour before being transferred to another bus.The roads in Dominican Republic leave a lot to be desired, with some sections having serious damage to the tarmac and many potholes. But there is only one short section which is really bad and the drivers know how to avoid the worst bumps. There were signs of this bad section being repaired and there is also evidence of a new road being built alongside, although I wouldn鈥檛 hold your breath for when it might be completed.There is an alternative of a transfer by helicopter which costs (I believe) around US$75 per person each way. Your luggage must travel separately and meet you at the hotel.Our room 鈥?2101 鈥?was a good size, clean and with a very large, comfortable 4-poster bed.The bathroom was fine and a good size, but we did miss the separate basins (sinks) 鈥?in Mexico we had his and hers basins. Also the shower, whilst fine and with plenty of power, was not as good as the walk-in showers in the Mexico resorts. But that鈥檚 just being a bit picky鈥︹€?We had swim-up room at both Mexico resorts and the rooms there were larger and with a better balcony / patio and private grass area and a second outside Jacuzzi . Having looked at the swim-up rooms at Punta Cana, we would not bother to pay the extra for one here.The resort is, as always with Excellence, beautifully furnished and maintained and the gardens are manicured to perfection. EPC has an advantage of being longer established than the Mexico resorts, so the gardens are more mature and the trees and shrubs are larger.For us, the outstanding feature of this resort is the beach. We are not beach people, but this has converted us (as long as we can find this quality). The sand is golden, soft, fine and clean (unlike Mexico). The sea is warm, clean and had wonderful waves for jumping in. This is NOT a swimming beach 鈥?if you want to swim in calm water, you need to walk a couple of hundred yards to the right (when looking out to sea) where the reef is further out and the waves are broken before they reach the shore.There is a system of warning flags for those wishing to go in the water. There are one or two life guards on duty all day and they are very observant and attentive. There is a black flag at each end of the patrolled area and when the sea is rougher they prefer people to stay together in the centre. When red flags are flying people can go in the water with care, but non swimmers should stay fairly shallow, because the waves are strong and there is quite an undertow when the water flows in and out. We had red flags every day except 2 stormy days when we had black flags and swimming was not allowed.. People were in the water on all except black flag days. It was great fun if you like sea bathing.The beach is raked every morning and there are plenty of sunloungers under palm trees and palapas. There are frequent visits from staff taking orders for drinks and at lunchtime a guy comes around the beach (and pool area) offering pizzas. In addition in good weather there is a 鈥渃ook out鈥?on the beach 鈥?of paella, or a Dominican dish, or a barbeque. In addition packs of sandwiches can be obtained from Sol bar. And don鈥檛 forget the soft ice cream dispenser around the side of Kaf茅 Caf茅 bar鈥︹€? So much choice鈥︹€?so many decisions.The pool areas are kept very clean and the pools are beautiful. There are plenty of sun loungers, The swim-up bar and Sol bar provided excellent service. There are 2 separate pools surrounded by buildings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. They tend to be quieter 鈥?partly because there is less shade in that area.There is a small 鈥渓ibrary鈥?of English language and other language books in the Clubhouse at the back of the beach and in the Sports bar (also, we believe in the Excellence Club).There are several gift and souvenir shops and a pharmacy outside the front entrance near to the attractive nature walk area.We should add that ALL staff in this resort are friendly, smiling and helpful.On the few occasions when problems occurred, we heard that they were dealt with promptly and efficiently.The restaurants are very similar in all 3 resorts and as usual there was a dinner choice from at least six out of the eight possible restaurants every evening. On only two occasions did we have to wait for a table 鈥?they provide a 鈥渂leeper鈥?to carry with you whilst you are at the bar. We ate in Chez Isabelle (French), Spice (Asian / Japanese), Toscana (Italian), Barcelona (Mediterranean), the Grill (Steaks) and the Lobster House (self explanatory).Our favourite was the French with the Japanese a close second. The only disappointment was the Lobster House 鈥?but that was because we just don鈥檛 happen to like Caribbean lobster, having previously been spoiled by Atlantic lobster (as found in New England).We did not try the Mexican restaurant (Agave), nor the pizza /pasta restaurant, although we heard good reports of the former. Most evenings there was an alternative barbeque offered on the plaza outside the theatre.Lunch restaurants were at an amazing buffet in Toscana, or at the Grill where the food is from a menu and served to the table.Breakfast is from another outstanding buffet in Toscana or with service in the Lobster House (not a lobster menu!).There are 7 bars (from memory) all offering a good range of quality alcohols and soft drinks. Our main difficulty was that there is no peaceful bar in the evening. The four open bars are all around the theatre area and are swamped by the extremely loud music from the entertainment, making conversation difficult or impossible. The Sports bar has a large screen TV so that is not a quiet haven either. Some shows may not appeal to your taste and for those staying longer than 7 days, you may not wish to see the weekly cycle a second time anyway. It would be good to be able to retreat to a quiet place with new friends and have a conversation.Although some of the entertainment was OK for us (it must be impossible to cater for all tastes) it was regrettable that the comp猫re鈥檚 many announcements and all music were played at such a high volume. We thought for a while that there must have been a convention of people who are hard of hearing鈥︹€?Apart from the main shows there is an excellent saxophonist who plays very well, but still finds it necessary to play directly into a microphone and through huge speakers, thus destroying the subtlety of his music. Similarly the music played outside on the Plaza in some early evenings 鈥?but at least the sound is muted in the open air.We did wander down to the disco one evening and enjoyed the night club atmosphere and some dancing. Now in a location like that, loud music is permitted if not essential !!By comparison, both the Excellence resorts in Mexico have a quieter bar area where one can avoid the entertainment if wished.But that is a small matter when one considers what an amazingly high standard is maintained in everything that Excellence do. Our only problem will be deciding which one to return to next time鈥︹€?.Health MattersThere have been some reports in the Forum and in Reviews about mosquitoes and stomach upsets at EPC. First it is important to be aware that people are affected differently by insect bites and by stomach problems. We took care to use insect repellent in the evenings but somehow both of us were bitten on a number of occasions. We think that happened on the beach during the daytime, rather than around the bars in the evening.Secondly we were careful to only use the bottled water supplied for drinking and for washing teeth and were selective about the fruits and salads we ate. Nevertheless my wife has a stomach upset about 4 days before the end of our holiday and the after-effects have lasted for 4 days since we returned home. We believe that the highest standards of hygiene exist in Excellence kitchens, but this is a tropical area and there are undoubtedly some risks. We did not suffer any bites or upset in either Mexico resort.Be warned and take with you the necessary repellents and medication.Punta Cana AirportOn arrival at the airport you will be required to pay US$20 per person entry visa, in cash.Another $20 per person is payable on the way out as a departure tax.After collecting luggage and passing through customs there are a large number of porters trying to take your cases and guide you to the correct desk to check-in for a transfer. It鈥檚 up to you whether to use a porter, but the walk is only 20 yards or so and all the desks are clearly signed. A similar thing happened when we returned at the end of the holiday 鈥?we were held in the minibus until all our luggage had been unloaded and given into the care of a group of porters who then try to insist that they must take you to check-in. In our case the end of the check-in line was about 10 yards from the minibus. We have wheeled cases and managed perfectly well on our own.The airport is not air conditioned and when busy it is very hot and crowded with inadequate seating. We were there for 2 hours mid-afternoon for a 6pm flight. The toilets are overwhelmed by the numbers of people trying to use them. There is one general gift shop selling rum and some other liquors, cigarettes, cigars and junk souvenirs and a couple of others selling some T-shirts and CDs / DVDs. The prices were way higher than the hotel shops and way, way higher than the beach stalls. The food outlets are basic and unappetising. We noticed some people had brought food from their hotel 鈥?a good idea if you still need food after an AI holiday of this quality!I am happy to receive PMs with any questions to help other travellers.

<Content>A Relaxing Vacation We visited during the period 23-29 November. This was our fifth Caribbean all inclusive, and it certainly offered more variety inside the resort than previously experienced on our other all inclusive vacations. We booked in July through VacationsToGo online, and they took care of everything quite nicely. Punta Cana ground transportation was handled by VIP Tours as part of the package, and the connections between the airport and the resort were flawless, with a stop at one other resort to drop others off. We found the slower ride part of the overall experience that gave us time to take it all in. Our open minds and adventuresome spirits helped us enjoy the ride from the airport to the resort for what it is, but the fact that our air and ground connections worked perfectly and our checked baggage arrived with us probably did a lot to set our mood. Just in case there was a baggage disconnect, we had enough in our carry on baggage to have dinner, sun bathe, and do anything else we might want to do for the first 24-36 hours. We were met with the legendary champagne and cool, moist towel; we had opted for the Excellence Club and booked an Excellence Club Junior Suite Garden View from the beginning; very nice, and no regrets for the extra price, for the amenities covered. We were on the 2nd floor of the 8000 building. The 4 poster bed was one of the most comfortable traveling beds we have ever had, nice and firm, which is what my wife and I prefer. Some specifics about the resort:1. We did have a single minor maintenance issue courtesy of a previous guest. All we had to do was mention it to our concierge Ricardo (an absolute ace!) in the Excellence Club office and it was taken care of. Also we created 2 maintenance issues of our own, and again they were taken care of immediately. Make sure you ask specifically about the plumbing rules to avoid plugging the toilet. 'Nuff said. Remember that most of the maintenance issues are not the fault of the hotel, but of the guests.2. If you want something specific, ask. When my wife saw what was in the room mini-bar, she asked if they would add a bottle of Bailey's Irish Cream; it was there within minutes. 3. If you don't see a room key sized Do Not Disturb/Make Up Room card to slip into your key slot, ask for one. They make several trips to your room through the day for cleaning, newspaper delivery, evening turn down service, and linen/towel replacement. 4. I have seen several complaints about no washcloths. They were there, only not with the other linens, but rolled discreetly on the vanity.5. Plenty of hangars, good iron, and ironing board are available in the room. The room safe worked great, and we used it; it had enough room for our money, wallets, passports, cell phones, 3 cameras, and an IPOD. Lesson learned: You reset the combination each time the safe is opened. Don't go fiddling around in the safe after having a few drinks. If you manage to make a mistake, it takes a trip to the front desk and a visit by security to get the safe opened. 6. We did our sunbathing on the beach rather than by the pools; more lounges available when you want them. People start reserving the ones around the pool really early.7. I am a gym rat. This resort has the best equipped/maintained facility I have ever used at a resort (health club quality, with 2 recumbent bikes, 2 upright bikes, 4 treadmills, several elliptical trainers, dumbbells, Smith machine, pec, shoulder, and abdominal, and lower body machines, and several multi-station machines for lats, shoulders, arms, and chest.8. We tried all the restaurants for dinner except The Grill and Agave. My favorites were Toscana and Chez Isabelle. Our expectations weren't met in the Lobster House. We took breakfast every morning in Toscana, great spread! So many choices...also the live piano music every morning for breakfast was a very nice touch. If you opt for any of the ground tours, you have to be transported over some of the same roads you took to the resort from the airport, so be prepared for a long ride We wanted to snorkel, and we signed up for a half day trip offering 2 opportunities, to snorkel with sting rays and nurse sharks, and then a run to an open water reef. We got signed up for the afternoon trip; that is normally when the VIP tour desk books the American guests. I understand the morning is multi-national. If I was going to do it again, I would ask about the morning trip, because late in year the light in the water on the reef isn't as good late in the afternoon. Also, the boat ride was a little rough, so if you think you might plan to do this, throw something for motion sickness in your luggage. After the snorkeling is done and the boat heads for the dock, things turn festive with an open bar, loud music; if you are already tired and feeling bad from the motion, it can be a long 45 minute run back to the dock, and even a longer ride back to the resort. We brought our own gear, but there was plenty of gear available on the boat.  My Spanish is somewhere between Beginner and Intermediate level. We got by very well with that, but it wasn't necessary for us to have a good time. Many of the guests had no Spanish. It doesn't hurt to put a smile on and treat all the staff with courtesy. We saw some guests that were absolute jerks that had no interaction with the resort staff except to be demanding; I suppose they will be the ones who complain the most about their visit. My suggestion is that if you want and expect things like you get in America, then vacation in Las Vegas.  We brought plenty of small bills for tipping, and although didn't feel any obligation to tip at any time, we tipped certain people that I felt made our visit special. If you tip, don't leave the tip on the table; the person you intend it for may not get it.  Enjoy your visit!

<Content>Amazing beach, lackluster food and bedding My husband and I just got back from an eight-day stay at Excellence Punta Cana.The Good:Amazing beach. Powder soft sand, palm trees are gorgeous. Plenty of sunchairs and towels to lie on; reserve a bed early with towels if you want a chance of getting one. They also provide a lending library if you want a beach read.The landscaping is superb. Not a leaf is out of place. Excellent gym and spa. Gym is new with a seperate room for classes and a room for all the new machines. High ceilings, no funky sweat smell. Tennis pro (Rolando) is a great teacher for both new and experienced tennis players. The spa is also wonderful, with many services offered (I'd highly recommend the evening massage for two on the beach) in a calm, sophisticated setting.Great horseriding opportunities. I'm an experienced rider, and I cantered on the beach every other morning in the ocean surf. I wish they provided helmets and fed the horses a bit more, but the horses know there way around and the guides are friendly.Great after-dinner music for dancing on the main plaza.Honest employees. My credit cards accidentally fell out of my purse on the beach, and they were returned to me that night by the staff who found them. I was very appreciative!!Roaming waiters attended to you on the beach to keep your drink full.The Bad:After checking in, I wasn't escorted to the room and just given a map, which was a bit of a let down. I would have appreciated a guide to my room and explanation of the room's amenities.If I could make just one recommendation to the hotel, it would be to upgrade the bedding linens. The mattress was flat (no springs, just resting on a sheet of plywood), and the pillows were also flat. If you're used to softer down pillows, get ready for some neck-aches. The blanket was pilling, and the comforter was tired and old looking. Think Super 8 bedding quality. Not good. The toiletries were also very basic. I saw the excellence club offerings, the quality was pretty much the same (we used the money we saved on not going with the upgrade to spend on activities, etc.).The food is also lacking. The only thing the resort does well is pizza, but even that gets old after a while. Yes, I enjoy good dining options where I live in DC, but I felt the resort never provided a single consistently good meal beyond pizza. For example, I tried the shrimp, apple, and avocado appetizer at the French restaurant, and it tasted like nothing. Totally bland. Puff pastry with snails consisted of rock hard pastry and escargot minced beyond recognition. The evening restaurant food isn't inedible, but the results don't live up to their descriptions. The breakfast buffet had lots of options and a good egg station, and the lunch spread was decent.Agressive vendors are found at either end of the property. Questions are always the same: What's your name? Where are you from? First time to DR? I've got a present for you. Come look at my shop. They are very persistent.

<Content>LOVED EVERY MOMENT I cannot not tell you what a great time we had on our Honeymoon and Excellence and their staff is to thank for that. Let me start from the very beginning:Ride form Airport to Hotel: A bumoy ride but a great change to see what the Dominican Republic looks like. Also we rode with VIP and they stopped at a local store so we could get beer for the ride so I was a happy camper.Arrival: To say the place takes your breath away is an understatement....it was absolute perfection. We received smiles and a welcome home and this treatment never stopped.Room: We were suppose to have an Excellence Club Honeymoon Suite but they had given our room away and I was pretty pissed about that but they put us in an Excellence Club Suite and it was very nice. Looking back now we will always get a normal room because we were not in the room very long. Needless to say my anger didn't last very long once I saw our view and got my bathing suit on!Food: Absolutly amazing my favorite was the Italian Restaurant and the Mexican for sure. I did contract a bacterial stomach infection but I wasnt very careful while I was there. My recommendation would be stay away from milk all together there pasterization processes arent like those in the states. Also watch drinking the slushy drinks from the machines because they are not required to keep those as clean like the states. Even with my tummy issues I forced myself to eat because the food was to good to pass up!Pools: I cant even describe how great they are!!! We miss our pool buddies!!Leaving Excellence: What a depressing day when you have to leave your new home We did take the helicopter ride back from the resort to the airport and it was worth every penny because the pictures and the views are priceles!!!Best honeymoon spot in the world it is all adult couples and I cant wait to go back!!

<Content>Our Wedding was PERFECT! We absolutely loved our stay at Excellence Punta Cana! We married there the week of Thanksgiving 2008. We took 16 others with us (ages 29 -60) and everyone really enjoyed it all. The resort is absolutely gorgeous! In fact, our photographer accompanied us and called it a photographer's dream. Not only was the staff incredibly nice, but our wedding coordinator, Ana, catered to our every need. We truly feel that our wedding day was perfect!

<Content>Beautiful and friendly My husband and I stayed at Excellence for 7 nights during Thanksgiving week.We travel alot and and have much experience with all inclusivesThe first 3 days the weather was not great because of a storm.But the resort is beautiful and the swimming pools are great.This place has 8 restaurants, each one from a different country.The food was amazing. Probably the best we have had in an all inclusive resorts.The only restaurant I would complain about is The Lobster Restaurant. The Lobster is from the Carribean and not near as tasty as the Main lobster most of us are used to. The service at this one restaurant was not very good either.The is the one and only complaint I have about this resort. The service and friendlyness of the staff was wonderful.The people at the spa know what they are doing! The massages for my husband and I were great!The conceirge desk is very accommodating in every aspect!The ocean here has waves, so if you want a flat, no waves ocean, you are going to have to stay somewhere else.I would recommend Excellence Punta Cana to any couple.

<Content>Resort was great, road to resort was awful The Excellence resort was a well appointed resort with a very well trained staff. I can not say enough good things about the resort itself. The food was great, drinks just right, rooms very nice, pool perfect, beach well kept ( sand very soft, hard to walk on the beach without sinking very deep) just a great time if you want to sit and do nothing. Not the place for an type A personality.If on the other hand you like to venture out to see things other than the resort this is not the place for you. It is 1 + hour away from anything else. Down the worst road you can imagine. I have been on many mission trips to places that have bad access but this just about beats them all. I would not go back just because of the trip to and from the hotel. We went on a snorkling trip, which by the way was one of the best I have every been on anywhere in the world, and the trip there and back almost ruined the experience. Again the resort was great I have no complaint about the actual resort.

<Content>Great Vacation! We stayed at the Excellence Nov. 22-29th. We took are two young adult children as our last family vacation together. The resort was very good! Required to pay $10.00 a piece at the airport. We rode on the tour bus to and from the airport - it took about 1 hour 10min. each way- with no stops in between. The roads arent that bad - but my daughter did get car sick. Everyone was friendly at the resort. Our kids were upgraded to the Excellence Club - they enjoyed the extras. We felt that it wasnt worth the money. We could go to their room, use the same beach and pool as they did. Our room was on the 2nd floor Excellence ocean view room. It was big with two sliding doors. Great view. We always tipped - and they are very grateful for $1-$5. I think that they would be nice and friendly either way. Make sure to bring plenty of money (dollars) there the ATM machine only gives pesos and they dont give out dollars at the front desk. We didnt have any trouble with finding chairs at the beach. It seems like everybody wants to be at the pool instead. The water is rough - but if you walked to the left of the resort on the beach and go to the bend t(big piece of wood in the sand) the water is smooth and great for swimming! The horseback riding was fun. The spa was the best! The foot heaven and excellence massages are the best! The food was good. Toscannas and Oregano we liked the best! Michael Jackson concert was good. We didnt see any mosquitos or bugs - probably the time of year we went. Best prices on buying stuff - see Paco at the resort store in the back. He gave us some great prices and better quality stuff!

<Content>Excellece is Excellente OK so my trip was supposed to be a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. Did not happen that way he decided not to go NOT MY BOYFRIEND ANYMORE. In any case I went on my vacation. The plane ride was the plane ride from h**l a family with 3 children on the flight let thier children cry and carry on for the entire 4hr flight. So now I'm thinking this trip is doomed. The bus ride to the hotel is a little long about an hour, however the driver from Pierto Tours was great, one of the other passenger was joking about how he could go for a beer the next thing we knew the driver pulled over to get beer. Once at the resort I forgot about the plane ride. We were greeted with champagne and cold wash cloths. I stayed in the Excellence Club. As soon as I gave my name to the host I was promptly greeted by my conceige, pointed to my bags and in my room within 10 minutes. In the Excellence Club you will find a fully stock bar (all top shelf), big screen TV, 3 computers w/free internet also food all day. I must say the food at this resort is the best that I have had in Punta Cana. This was my 4th visit to Punta Cana. This resort is by far the best of the 3 that I have stayed in. I consider myself a very picky eater and I must say I have no complains about the food. I would advise anyone travel outside the U.S. to always pack some snack foods if you are like me you will crave some potato chips or candy. The room was large and had stocked bar with liquor. I do not like the Dominican rum that was left in my room so I asked if it could be replaced with Bacardi rum, I had the bottle within minutes. I will suggest that you bring you own iron the one in the room was not a steam iron and if you were not very very careful your cloths will be burnt. The beach and the ocean were great the water was warm but very rough and you are on the Pacific ocean. If you want to pick up a gift for someone go to Nancys she will bargain and give a great deal. Also if you want a massage ask Nancy it's only $45 for 70 minutes. Nancy is located on the beach if facing the ocean go to the left just outside the resort line. If you want to have fun I suggest you get involed in the daily activities offered by the resort and the entertainment crew. (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez ) I must say the entertainment crew are wonderful people they work really hard and long hours but are always smiling and very cheerful and upbeat. I must say if it was not for the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) my trip would not have been as wonderful as it was. The nightly shows were great. The disco is a must while you are there go and learn a new dance from the Entertainment crew (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) If you want to plan an excursion go see Johnny @ Pierto Tours in the lobby. I did the zipline what a blast. I will say the staff at this resort go above and beyond their duties to make your stay enjoyable and accomodating. For example one day they had rice pudding (very good) out and I did not see it the next day and asked for it they brought some out to me right away. The head chef is walking around to make sure everyone is satisfied.TO MANAGEMENT AT THIS RESORT YOUR ENTERTAIMENT CREW (Cesar,Santo,Mariel and Inez) SHOULD RECIEVE A RAISE OR A BONUS.THIS IS A 5 STAR PLUS RESORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>3rd time at Excellence Punta Cana This is our 3rd time at Excellence Punta Cana. The first 2 times were when it was under the Secrets name. Since it is now Excellence I have noticed improvements in the resort. For example, the gym is outstanding and is the best resort gym I have been too. The food is also outstanding and once again they have Budweiser and Bud Light in bottles. The people are excellence and I would like to thank Elvira GILL for all she did to make my birthday and stay a wonderful vacation.The resort is a 5 star plus and I recommended it to my boss and he also loved it. I recommend this resort to everyone and I haven't found anything here I was disappointed in.

<Content>Amazing vacation! Can't wait to go back. My husband and I recently returned from a wonderful 5 night stay at the Excellence PC hotel at the beginning of November. It was nothing but spectacular for both of us! I am baffled at some of the negative reviews that this resort has received. This place was a perfect choice for my husband and I as we were celebrating our 17th anniversary and were lucky enough to get a family member to baby-sit so we could have some adult only time. We were not disappointed.We had a very trying time getting to Punta Cana due to our American Airlines flight in Miami that had us sit for 4+ hours in the plane before they finally brought in a new plane. We did not arrive at the resort until sometime late in the evening. This was much later than we expected but were greeted with smiles from the staff and a cold towel and champagne. I noticed that we were with another couple who bought the Excellence upgrade but we were checked in the same way so I am still confused as to why someone would get this upgrade. Our luggage was promptly delivered to our room (5 mins) after check-in and we decided to go out to Oregeno for our dinner as we were advised by the front desk this would be the quickest way to a meal since he could tell we were very tired and hungry. We were not disappointed and after several main courses and more than a bottle of wine, we happily walked the short distance to our room for a peaceful nights sleep.I thought our room location was perfect. We were in building 6 which was just a few steps from the Barcelona, Touscana, and the Grill restaurants. This was also right by the main pool and swim up bar. Normally, I would not like to be so close to everything due to noise but this resort is quiet at night and it was the perfect place for us. It was so convenient to run back to the room for whatever we needed. Also, our room AC worked very well for us and we had no complaints. We were located on the 2nd floor. Our room was nice and the only complaint we had about it was the wireless access was weak. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and a restocked mini bar. Also, each evening we received turn down service with chocolates on the pillow. As far as bugs in the room, I never saw a single one. I lived many yrs in S. Florida and Texas and were use to an occasional critter but never saw one here. The mosquitoes were not a problem for us either. We brought our own spray but rarely used it and the were even offered spray at night at the sports bar.Both of us thought the food was extremely good. While some dishes were different than what we were use to, they tasted very good and there was plenty of variety to choose from. We liked the breakfast and lunch buffets along with our favorite dinner being at the Grill sitting on an elevated area that is directly over the pool. We never waited more than 10 mins for a table and always enjoyed meeting the people around us. We took advantage of the room service on a few occasions and were thrilled with the prompt service(15-20mins wait) and always greeted with a smile. Nothing like having a waiter deliver you hot appetizers and a bottle of wine to your room to start off the evening.I was worried about the beach as I had heard it was rough to swim in. They did have 陆 the beach black flagged while the other 陆 was red flagged every day. It鈥檚 pretty obvious that they cut the beach down so there is less area for the lifeguards to cover. The waves were nothing different that what I have seen in Florida and I have done triathlons in much more challenging water that this was. With that said, they did keep an eye on everyone and make sure you did not go out too far. My husband was determined to do some serious body surfing as he loves these types of waves and has a lot of experience with them. He made the lifeguards nervous at first but they finally gave up on him and he agreed to go just off the resort to have his fun. I am more in to calm clear ocean water and was not disappointed as I could take a 2 min easy jog down the beach to find what I wanted. This was perfect to float around in or swim along the beach for exercise. No jelly fish or sea weed to worry about in the water and the staff does an amazing job of cleaning up the beach each day. My husband and I would take a late afternoon run each day down the beach for about 35-40mins. This was very enjoyable and we got to see a bit more of the area on either side of the resort.My favorite spot in the whole resort was the main pool. This pool is simply amazing in the way they designed it. I spent most of my time here as I could float around, join in some activities, get a drink from a waiter, or sometimes get a hot pizza for lunch. There was always plenty of lounge chairs in the sun or shade and I could usually find a pool float without too much work. I do wish that some of the guests were more considerate and did not take a float and stick it under their chair. I came close to grabbing one once as I almost didn鈥檛 not find a free one in the pool. Also, the beds by the pool appeared to be nice but they were hard to get as people would come out very early in the morning to claim them with putting their things on it. I would not mind this so much if they used it all day but I did not like to continue walking by one that never seem to have anyone using it.The staff was the best part of our whole trip. We have never been treated so nice and graciously in any place we have visited before. They were constantly smiling and asking if we needed anything. I can鈥檛 say enough good things about all the wonderful people we met who worked there. We are definitely thinking about a return trip to the Excellence sometime in the future. This is truly an amazing place for a couple to get away and have a wonderful relaxing time!

<Content>Perfect time I spent a week from Nov. 22 to Nov. 29 at the Excellence Punta Cana Resort; it was superb, I enjoyed every minute. The resort has a very relaxing atmosphere and despite there were many people during the Thanksgiving week it never felt busy. The weather was not so good at the beginning of my stay but improved every day; at the end it was almost as perfect as it can be. There was always enough lounge chairs either at the beach or at the pool to enjoy the sunshine. The ocean was a bit rough for swimming and if you like snorkelling you better book a trip at the resort to the nearby reef. There are numerous activities that you can participate in throughout day and night. The entertainment staff makes sure that you're having tons of fun; especially with Mariel and Santo I always had a great laugh; dancing Merengue was great. Everybody in the resort is very friendly and helpful. There is a big choice of different restaurants and the food is very diversified; I liked it pretty much. Wherever you are in this resort if you want to relax this is the place where you want to be.

<Content>NEVER EVER AGAIN, don't go!! Fist of all we are not naive, are extremely well travelled and are realistic in our expectations!!! We ignored most of the negative comments from trip advisor and took the common notion of people just like to complain (we didn't expect to be doing the same 14 days later!!) so we departed with our hard earned cash and booked this amazing holiday, a romantic get a way, adult only, with expectations of relaxation, good food, friendly service and a stress free holiday!! we understand that it's the Caribbean, that it's a tired resort and are the first to say that the grounds on which the resort is are breathe taking, but they shouldn't be graded as a 5 star hotel and charging you for the privileged.ACCOMMODATION:So we arrived at the hotel, late unfortunately we had had a delay in flight not the hotels or anyone's fault just one of them things!! but everything was going to be great for the next 14 days, well not quite, we had made sure when booking that we had a ocean view room, we wanted to see the ocean, but got there to be told that this was unavailable, HOW can a room be unavailable when it has been sold to you six months in advance, with guarantee, so we were UPGRADED, a master suite, or what was supposedly a master suite, okay it has an extra room but the room smelt of mould and was musty as previous reviews had said, it was so bad that we ended buying scented candles from the spa to keep the smell at bay, it was looking over the tennis courts and the cascade pool, now the room got no sunlight during the day, it looked like it hadn't been maintained at all, the door lock was broken and there was a gaping crack in the door, the coffee maker didn't work and it just didn't seem like 5 star accommodation to us but we tried to continue with our holiday and brush it off, who spends time in there room right!!! After complaining for six days we finally got the room we had paid for an ocean view and it was AMAZING bright, no smell, the view was lovely we ended up spending evenings out on the balcony watching the ocean listening to the waves, even the coffee maker worked!!! Now after a few days we got talking to other couples who had exactly the same experience as us, had booked an ocean view, or garden terrace with the guarantee of having that room and where told that it was unavailable, DON'T LET it happen to you, you pay extra supplements for these rooms you want what you pay for!!!FOOD: what can we say about the food!!! no way five star, they say there are 8 restaurants they are not really restaurants, they are limited in choice, don't get us wrong they do pizzas, hamburgers and other fast foodie stuff good, but if you are after a fantastic meal of delight in flavours don't go to the excellence. We on numerous occasions where served cold food, we aren't silly we stayed away from most of the buffet stuff its been sitting a long time and doesn't seem to be checked and changed as we have experienced in true 5 star hotels. SICKNESS: everyone we spoke to had at some stage in their holiday been sick, bad stomachs, gripping pains, diarrhoea. My husband ended up in hospital for a day in Punta Cana with an intestinal infection on an IV drip, now we have travelled across the tropics, all over Asia, have even eaten from a few side of the road stalls before and we have a good constitution, have never experienced upset stomachs like it but he was poorly and has come away from DOM REP with a number of tablets as a souvenir. BE careful make sure you get everything hot, make sure your eggs are well done and stay away from the buffet food.SERVICE: We don't mind tipping for good service, it is a third world country, the staff work extremely hard, but it is at a stage now that it is expected. All this advice on tipping the staff so they look after you better is really true, you should not be expected to tip for everything, you pay enough for the holiday and it should be at your discretion if you feel you want to tip an individual for good service. There are guests at the hotel that tip constantly, for every drink ordered, for daily chamber service, for room service for everything, this really has created expectations from the staff for tips for doing their jobs, like i say we tip for good service but shouldn't have to feel pressured to do so, and it certainly shouldn't affect the service provided if you don't. ENTERTAINMENT: There are no red coats like at Butlins but they are green t-shirts. entertainment is a joke, okay yes it's the Carribbean but why is this the excuse for everything, it's bad, you will want to spend time in your room, people in wigs, badly miming to music, you need to be drunk to even think its okay, we don't drink heavily that's may be the problem on this whole holiday if you are after sophistication, romance and mature evenings the excellence is not for you, if you like to get drunk all day and don't have high expectations of food and entertainment and like to see adults getting loud, obnoxious and rude, this is the place to go!!!

<Content>We Loved It, Given Our Expectations We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Excellence, while noticing many of the the things we expected to see/experience thanks to reading months of reviews. The arrival and check through at the airport is the easiest you can ever experience. No hassles, the lines moved as fast as one could walk and 5 min. after you step off the plane you are grabbing your checked luggage and off to your transport. The ride to the property wasn't bad at all, this was typical of the third world and we had a rep from VIP travel aboard as well as the driver to tell us about his country and what to expect from our stay(we knew already, but he told us to brush teeth/drink w/ bottled water only).Arrival and check in was swift and friendly. The room is beautiful as we always book lowest category...it's still a suite!...best we've ever had.. there were a few issues there(some sugar ants,mini fridge luke-cool and such), but we are very easy to please and they didn't cast a cloud in any way to the room. Channel 21 was a plus, wife and I enjoyed that if not for the obvious, but the hilarity of some of it. The food in the restuarants was not bad, nor spectacular, but we knew this going in and didn't starve. Breakfast we would have liked to be a bit better..as they have cooked to order omelets/eggs/pancakes, but very little as far as choice as to what goes in them..chunked ham, shredded cheese, bell pep, and onion was it for the omelets..Other places have had the same w/ mushrooms, spinach, even crab meat, which let the wife down a bit.Many choices on the bfast buffet but too many which were'nt breakfast fare(chili, grilled chicken and such) The ala carte rests.(tried them all) were good, as we never waited to get in and they did better than we expected..lobster house..just like they say...we had to try it and it just isn't great. Drinks- all good, every bar , we were surprised to see that most of the frozen drinks like pina coladas are very fibrous, as you chew on them as much as you sip from the straw, tasty though. All the premium hooch is there, just ask. The pool-chair-towel situation is horrendous...just like they say..Wife and I realized on day 1..if you can't beat em, join em...so I actually got up early every day before my 1st coffee or BM and layed out a book, beach bag, sunblock cans, and everything like at 7AM (When all the Europeans did it).So you could say that we were some of the worst culprits in this routine, but you do what you have to...if you want a chance all day to be able to hang at the pool. The beach- Gorgeous, but not very user friendly. The waves are too intimidating to try going in and I predict that this is the case year round. Others have stated that a short walk off the property brings a calmer section...this is true but you'll never have it calm enough to feel comfortable really swimming in.Great view, though. A spectacularly beautiful, yet violent, beach. Right off the property on the beach is the shack mall shopping...very nice as we were prepared to haggle we did'nt as the $$ they were asking was very fair (Nancy wanted $20 for 3 t-shirts) I felt like I'd be a jerk to try to talk her down from that. Definitely visit these folks...remember...the wares they sell are All exactly what you see for sale at the vendor tables!! for very less $$. We came prepared for every stomach ailment w/ meds we brought from home..and did find them very useful even without over indulging in the food/drink/sun. We were a little disappointed in the evenings as everything revolves around the nightly theater show. It is very consistantly good, but not what we really care for on a romantic getaway(one night was actually karaoke night, anyone who has experienced a bowling alley lounge knows how this can get annoying, especially with the volume.We prefer to continue our pool time(in a functional jacuzzi,none were working) in the evenings outside w/ an open bar close by..that's not the case at Excellence but it's just their policy..pools closed at 6 pm ,nights could get a little on the cool side anyway(always a good breeze, though).Mosquitos were not an issue, we came prepared but did'nt experience them at all. Like a previous poster said, they must have moved on.The service is the best in the world. Top notch staff, more extra touches than one could imagine....any all inclusive could learn from this place!! Take care walking around the resort as all the floors resemble, or are, marble and get very slick. The social scene is more reserved here on the whole. We met some couples that were awesome and will probably stay in touch with(as we always do) but it's more of a mixed bag of nationalities than most places in the carribbean (with their varied languages) which makes it a bit more difficult to bond with other guests, even if you are an extrovert. All in all it was wonderful, though..We knew most of it going in, and feel like we got what we paid for.As for returning, I would say yes...but maybe a few years in the future..if finances dictate Punta Cana, or nothing...

<Content>Loved Every Minute My husband and I just came back from a week's stay at Excellence Punta Cana. We truly loved every minute of it. As we had been told, the ride from the airport is 1 hour and somewhat bumpy, but we have traveled several times before and we did not think it was that bad. And once we got to the resort we forgot about it. We were greeted with champagne at the hotel steps and check-in was quick and easy. Then we were off to the beach bar to wait for our room to be ready. Everyone was so friendly. We had a swim-out room and it was just lovely and only about 6 steps and we were in the pool. There were two pools outside our room and our own bar that had sandwiches and fruit for lunch. This pool was quiet and there were only a handful of people there. The main pool was where all the action was -- games, water aerobics, music, etc. The restaurants were very good too. Every day you got an itinerary in your room that included which restaurants were open and which ones were closed, what the entertainment was that day and also what the drink of the day would be! Naturally we had to have one every day. There were many restaurants, including French, Mexican, Mediterrean, Oriental and Italian. There was also a grill and an excellent buffet. There was a particular girl at the resort named Ines who went out of her way to make sure we had a good time. I don't know when she ever slept because it seemed like she was always there. She is definitely an asset to the resort. I couldn't say enough about her and I would recommend Excellence to any of my friends because I know she will take good care of them during their stay. And we also loved the saxaphone player, Domingo. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. He not only played a song for us, but he autographed two of his CD's and I gave them to my husband as part of his gift. Whenever we play them at home we will remember our stay at Excellence Punta Cana.

<Content>Worth the Trip--Straight Facts from a New Yorker My boyfriend and I took a trip to the resort from 11/22 to 11/28, the first time at Excellence for both of us. My main goal was to relax, worry about nothing, and spend all day lounging by a beautiful beach or pool--and that's just how it turned out. Some of the reviews other people left made me worry, but now that I'm back I wanted to write my own review so that people would know they have nothing to worry about:ROOMS are nice--just as they appear on the website. We were on the ground floor and had no problems with bugs. In fact, we didn't even get more than a few bites from all the nights we went outside--and it's silly to complain if you do as bugs come with the territory on a tropical island.The FOOD was very good. I get sick often, even in NYC, so I came prepared with all sorts of antacids and pepto just in case...and I never had to take it once. My boyfriend used tap water, ice, and ate his face off--and he didn't have a problem, either. You are honestly just as likely to get sick here (on a nice resort with filtered water) as you are at home. As far as the taste, you cannot expect the food to rival a meal in a top restaurant in a major city, but we came with an open mind and were impressed with the variety and quality. A few callouts: the Banana Mama drink is AMAZING, there is an ice-cream machine at the bar right outside of the lobby, and breakfast at the Lobster House (which we just assumed would be a so-so buffet) turned out to have a great a la carte menu with lots of options that would satisfy anyone.The RIDE from the airport took about an hour, but who in their right mind expects a country this poor to have paved asphalt streets??? Ignore what people say about it being horribly bumpy. The roads are simply unpaved, and my boyfriend and I both laughed like this is it? this is what people said was so bad?. I get extremely car sick and I took a Bonine about 30 minutes before the ride (we took a private taxi--recommended). I enjoyed the scenery and chatting with our driver about the island--I didn't even feel like I had to lay down--the bumpy areas are just part of the deal when you travel to an island.RAIN is inevitable in the caribbean--it's just a matter of luck, and the first two days of our trip were rainy or windy, so we spent the time inside. We played tennis--it's very easy to get court time, and everything is free, and worked out at the gym, which was VERY well equipped. We also got a couples massage at the spa, and it was very good--check the resort paper the maid leaves to see the daily spa specials. We got a great deal. And since another reviewer mentioned movie rentals--one of the entertainment booths in the lobby is solely for renting movies. They had a lot of them, and we rented one during a rainy night. It was $7 a movie.TIPPING, like people said, is not expected, but you will want to, so definitely have some singles when you're on the beach or going out to dinner. The greedy POOL/BEACH CHAIR situation? We didn't notice one. We spent most of our time on the beach and there were always chairs, and we even found beds a few times easily. Maybe the chairs by the pool tend to fill up more quickly, but every time it got hot on the beach and we headed up to the pool for a swim, we found a bed right away. They also bring personal pizzas around on the beach and by the pool, which was nice, so you don't even have to take a break from the sun for lunch if you don't want to.The EXCELLENCE CLUB seemed completely unnecessary, in our opinion. Naturally they will pitch you to upgrade when you check in, but from what we could tell the only difference was a buffet and more stuff in your minibar--who cares? We barely used the minibar--why would you when you can sit OUTSIDE in the SUN and have people bring drinks to you? So all in all, nothing I was worried about turned out to be an issue, we had a great time, and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.

<Content>Excellence Was Excellent! EVERYTHING @ Excellence Punta Cana was superb from the moment we arrived and were greeted with champagne, cool fragrant towels, and a welcome home from the staff. The bell staff: Vidal Morales, Eduard, Eduardo, Francisco, and Miguel Diaz were extremely helpful guiding us through the resort and genuinely made us feel welcome. Executive chef Berthold Dettweiler Kopf along with a host of chefs and restaurants manager Victor Doroteo were the overseers of eight [8] restaurants, each serving magnificent meals with a wait staff unparrelled to any I've ever seen. The entertainment staff, especially Cesar, was always on hand to keep you as busy as you wanted to be. Front desk [Raul, Ibhar], wait staff [Luz Mary, Yeni, Joan] and all the bartenders were extremely pleasant, polite, and proficient. The service was absolutely spectacular in every area, and we will definitey return to Excellence, Punta Cana.

<Content>Not the same the second time My wife and I just returned from Excellence where we stayed from 11/21-11/26. This was our second time staying at Excellence and was far less enjoyable than our first visit in July 2007. Here are some of the issues we noticed this time: * The pool chair/towel insanity. As previous reviewers have mentioned, most pool chairs are reserved with towels and personal belongings by 9:00 AM and all towels are gone from the towel shelves by this time as well. So if you have a massage in the morning or go horse back riding at 10 AM or simply want to sleep in you literally will have no place to sit at the pool and no way to get a pool towel. There seems to be no recognition from the staff that this is a problem. * The food. While I appreciate the resort's variety of food options, including Asian, French, Mexican, pizza, hamburgers/sandwiches, and Italian, the result is that none of the food is particularly good. The best food is the simplest, like breakfast buffet items and food from the Grill like hamburgers. Asking chefs in a tropical resort to be experts in Japanese or French food is going to lead to disappointment for most people. Some of the food was okay, but we left dinner most night unsatisfied and sometimes still hungry. Compounding the problem is that the menus are written by workers with a limited command of English, describing food that they probably don't have a good idea about. As a result you sometimes literally have no idea what you are ordering.* Sickness. Like others have mentioned, both my wife and I got sick during our time at Excellence. Since we never left the resort, we can only assume that some food or drink at the resort was the problem. We have traveled to various places in the Caribbean and to Tanzania in Africa and have never gotten sick like we did at Excellence. Not fun.While we enjoyed aspects of our trip, we were disappointed that we would have to deal with these issues at a 5 star resort.

<Content>Fabulous Trip, only downfall is the weather didn't cooperate! So after reading many negative reviews I was a little nervous about staying at the Excellence, but all of my great expectations were surpassed and we had a wonderful time!! We booked a private car to bring us to the hotel b/c we wanted to have the most direct trip possible, with no stopping at other hotels. We went thru Mikes Marina, and they were fabulous! It was a long ride, about an hour, and yes, the roads were bumpy, but not NEARLY as bad as I expected after reading so many horrible reviews! I actually fell asleep a few times, so it couldnt have been too scarY!Upon arrival we were greeted with champagne and quick service. Unfortunately it was raining, and apparently had been all day, so that was a bummer, but the lobby still looked beautiful in the rain!Our room was very very nice. I loved the huge bathroom area and jacuzzi tub, looking into the bedroom. We were supposed to have an ocean view, but wasn't that great. We had a lot of foliage in front of our balcony, adn the pool was right in front of us and the ocean was to the far left. Close enough to see that the waves were HUGE but i wouldn't call it ocean view really....more like pool view. We had no problems with bugs in our room, and the mini bar was stocked DAILY, along with daily room cleaning and nightly turn down service. We did leave a few bucks each day b/c we had special requests for beer, etc. Unfortunately the weather was not good when we were there. I didnt know it coudl be so rainy/cloudy so many days in a row in the carribbean, (other than hurricanes of course)! It was either really cloudy/windy/cool, or MONSOON rains!! We didnt have sunny and gorgeous until our last day. Bummer..but what can ya do? We just took advantage of being on vacation and went to the lobby bars!! I wish there was more to do when the weather isn't good, b/c all the daily activities, etc. are outside. We even wanted to rent a movie one day but they don't have Pay Per view or any rentals that you can do. We worked out and went to the spa one day. The gym was VERY VERY nice. STate of the art machines and equipment. I was shocked. It was nice on our rainy days to get a workout in in the morning. The Spa was lovely. We went there one day too to have services done and really enjoyed.I was a little nervous about the food but we loved it all! Of course here and there my stomach would be a little crampy, but when youre eating out fo the country, and drinking allllll day long , its expected. We ate at every restaurant except Lobster house and they were all phenomenal! We ate at the grill mostly for lunch......great sandwiches!! The last few days we ate at Toscana and the lunch buffet was amazing...alogn with the pizza station and a pasta station. Wow. Glad we didnt eat there every day or we would have gained twice as much weight!! Bars and entertainment at night were fun. Some of hte shows were hilarious!! FYI - the olives in the martinis are not pitted, so dont choke!!The beach is gorgeous.....but with the rains/storm we had, the ocean was extra choppy. HUGE waves, so after going in past your knees, the lifeguard would be blowing his whistle to get back on shore. Pool is very very nice. Need to get chairs by 930am or so , or its tough to find any. Beds you need by 830am or so. Like I said, the weather wasn't good, so we didnt get a day at the pool until our last day :( so sad!Coco Locos - yummmm. Real coconuts they machete open and mix the real coconut milk with 151 rum. good stuff. What else was there to do when its rainy , but drink!?!? Didnt pay for Excellence Club b/c we like our room anyways, and the LAST THING we needed was bottles of liquor in our room. We would have been trashed!! Beer was good enough for the fridge (along with diet cokes, and lots and lots of water). Make sure you use the bottled water for teeth brushing...overheard someone say they got sick after drinking tap to take a pill. All the water in the restaurants is filtered. Overall I would say we had a 8 out of 10 trip....and it would have been a 9 or even 10 if the weather was good! We just picked a bad week. It was gorgeous before we got there, and was stunning the day we left. I was at least able to get a little tan before coming back to cold Boston! Any questions feel free to ask. Dont worry about any negative reviews....Excellence is an excelllent resort....and we travel A LOT!!

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed at EPC Nov.18-25, and loved every minute of it! The weather was not great, it rained all day one day, and on/off another. There was also a lot of cloudy windy days. We actually didin't miss it that much. The spa is awesome! We had a hot stone massage, and a couple's massage. Both were wonderful. The couple's massage, they give you a chilling bottle of champagne and chocolates after. It was so nice. My husband also got his scuba diving certification there. The team at the dive shop was great. Reggie was his instructor, and was fantastic. Our room was great. We had room 4102, right at the cascade pool. It is one of the few rooms with a semi-private balcony, as there is trees in front, so we felt we had some privacy.We had no ants, or bugs, mini-bar and snacks were filled daily, but we did leave him a tip every day. We also asked for a bottle of smirnoff and some clamato juice in our room, as I don't like beer. We gave him a couple of bucks, and he brought it, no problem.We saw a few of the shows. The circus show was amazing. I haven't been to an all-inclusive yet that put on a show like that . The only problem I found was the lounge chairs. It woun't be so bad, if people didn't reserve them, and then not use them all day. I was at one resort(can't remember which one) that if you didn't use your chair for two hours, you lost it. This should be done everywhere, so everyone gets a chair. People had towels on chairs all day, and never used them once!Overall, we loved this resort. For couples,it's a perfect romantic getaway. We'll be back!

<Content>No Where Near Excellence This was a long awaited vacation with 2 other couples that we travel with every year, sometimes twice a year. Before booking the resort, I emailed the Excellence head office and asked about internet access, I am self-employed and all of my vacations are working vacations and I cannot book without the resort having internet. The head office emailed me back very quickly with a response explaining that the whole resort including all the rooms have wireless internet access..Bonus..I booked our trip that day!! We arrived at the resort very late on Saturday night, service was friendly but we were sent to find our own rooms, through some hallways that were very dark, one of the couples was in 11 block and 2 of us were in 14 block. We found our rooms with help from the pizza delivery guy. The room was very nice, not very cool, the air conditioning on the 3rd floor of the resorts doesn't seem to work very good! I setup my computer to make sure there was internet..no network to be found, I called to the front desk and explained, he said that he wasn't sure about the internet and that some of the rooms could not connect, I decided to go back to the front desk to request a room change and/or see what could be done, the person at the front desk did not speak the best english and he proceeded to try to find another room...this took about an hour of him playing on the computer...he said that he would have a bellhop take me to another room to see if the internet worked...it is not 12:30am and we finally found a room that is vacant and has internet, awesome...lets move the bags down! NO NO..I need to check with the front desk, the person at the front desk explaines that the room is VIP and it has a view....I explain that I do not care about a view...I just need the internet..the reception explains that I can have the room for an extra charge $, after arguing with the gentleman for 10 to 15 minutes and not getting a head, I asked for his manager...no managers on staff at night, it is now 1am and i am told that there will be a manager in the hotel at 8am, I agree to stay in my room until the morning.My husband and I are in the lobby for 8am...no manager no concierge, I am told they will be there for 9am, I return at 9am to speak with the concierge, I explained the situation and she asked that I give her an hour, at 10am I returned, she had sorted the problem out and was giving us the VIP room that we were in the night before, but we needed to wait until 12:30, she then put me intouch with a manager (Edward), he explained that he wanted to have the room clean and that he would have a bellhop at our current room for 12:30, I waited at the room and no bellhop, called to the front desk to request service and they asked me to wait until 1:30...I was extremely upset and angry, I said absolutely not, I need service not and asked that someone come immediately, the bellhop was sent. I finally got into my room and unpacked, the room was clean but things were missing, coffeemaker with no coffee pot, no hand soap, no face clothes and 1 hand towel, 1 robe, I called down to the front desk and asked for the items, I received the robe and hand towel...the next morning I called to ask again for the coffee pot and received room service instead, this is better then the coffee pot that is what I was told!! My husband and I were waiting in the main lobby for our friends where we were approached from a hotel employee who seem to be a manager, he ended up being the General Manager of the hotel, after explaining the problems, he asked that I come and see him if we had anymore...I told him about the coffee pot and there was 1 in my room within minutes.After meeting him, we had a few more discussions about his hotel..for 1 of the couples - no turn down service for 2 or 3 nights and no cleaning service at all for one day, and there AC did not work right for the whole week even after complaining a few times to concierge. For another couple - no face clothes and limited towels, there DVD player and jacuzzi tub did not work...they did fix the tub but it took a day or so! For my husband and I..the room was ok...not a 5 star hotel by any means, still never received hand soap, and our jacuzzi would not hold water. We also had a few creepy crawlers in our room!! Restaurants - the buffet is great for breakfast and lunch and the only place we enjoyed for dinner was the french restaurant. The grill was terrible, Bareclona was ok...the seafood was very fishy smelling and tasting. Toscana-food was good the service was aweful! The beef in most restaurants was not good, over cooked and very tuff!!Grounds - very very nice, the beach was good, but it was red flagged for the whole week. Bar Staff - EXCELLENT...Jenny who works in the theater section is awesome...very ver friendly!We requested 1 room for all of us on the last day because of the late check out, the manager said that he would speak to us on Friday (the day before leaving) to see if they had one available, he explained that there was a $20 per person per hour charge....I looked at him and said NO WAY...with all the problems you want to charge us more....forget it!!! he told me to come back and see him on Friday and he would see what he could do...we ended up getting one room for the 6 of us to stay in until we had to leave for the airport.In whole, the resort is nice but I do not believe it should be classified as a 5 star..maybe 3.5...they really need to work on the little things!!! I don't believe I will ever be back unless they make some serious chanages.

<Content>Excellence was awesome My wife and I traveled to Excellence 11/20-11/26 and had a great time. We have been to Punta Cana three other times, Melia Caribe with our kids-very nice, Paradisus Palma Real just ourselves was nice and Grand Paradise with the kids-horrible).The worst part about this resort is the drive there and back, the roads are terrible and it is over an hour. Once you are there, enjoy it!The food is very good considering where you are, the rooms are nice, pools are clean and clear, lots of beach chairs. The beach is nice, alittle windy since you are on the atlantic side but if you walk to the left near the point, nice calm waters.The drinks were fantastic, first class all the way. The staff was very helpful and friendly and almost everyone spoke english.The best part of Excellence was the choice of restaurants and no need to make reservations. this was a truly stress free vacation, no where to go, nothing to do but relax, drink and enjoy paella on the beack or delivered pizzas by the pool.The entertainment was fine and we always found something to do if we wanted to. This is a great resort and we would return. One fun note for those of you going for romance, the show free porn on channel 21 24 horus a day, enjoy!

<Content>Worth the Trip Returned on Nov 18th from a 5 day trip to the Resort. The hotel is located about 1 hour from the airport. Other reviewers complianed about the bumpy road, even suggesting to take gravol pills. These folks obviously don't travel much. The in-land road is fine (although the return transfer took the other road and it was somewhat bumpy at times) but leave the gravol at home.We went on-line and found a local company (Viator) that arranges ground transportation. It is considerably more affordable then anything the hotel can book for you. While the risk is you will stop at other properties along the way...who cares. Our trip to the resort had two other couples, one staying at the Dreams next store and the other like ourselves going to the Excellence. Returning to the airport we were by ourselves. The total return cost for two was about US$86. In using this service though note: once outside of the airport you will have to make contact with most likely CocoTours in one of the booths. They will attempt to commit you to attend a time share presentation. If you have no interest simply state that and they will then take you to the vehicle. At the hotel 24 hours prior to departure you must re-confrim your ground transportation. They have representatives on-site for this at the booths just off the main lobby.There is no need to be prepared for a war with mosquitos as there were none. Perhaps they've moved on.The property is isolated and is one of 3-4 properties in the area. Unless you have rented a car don't plan on leaving the property for any night life as there isn't any place to really go unless you drive back to the main hotel strip probably 45 minutes to an hour away. The hotel entertainment is varied each night, it is enjoyable but you won't be confused with a Vegas show. The property does have a Casino (we are told) but it was closed for renovations. In booking for a stay over the next month or so I'd check to see if it has re-opened if this is important to you.As many others have stated the beach is unbelievable. They have lots of lounge chairs and even a number of beds to enjoy the beach. To my knowledge though there is no bar service on the beach (at least I didn't see any). Yes the beach is on the Atlantic side but what this really means is that you will experience great waves for body surfing or simply to enjoy. There is no sea-weed or rocks, the water is clean and warmer than the pools. Because of the waves the hotel monitors the water (actually has a staff person with a whistle walking the beach) and will place flags along usually the northern portion of the beach to tell you its off limits for swimming. Simply move in a southern direction and you will be able to swim (about 1/2 of the hotel beach front is swimable.)The hotel pool is unique. It winds its way along much of the beach front and in total is likely 1/4 - 1/2 mile in length. As the pictures in the tour books show it fronts some of the buildings and winds around some of the restaurants. Of course there is a swim up bar albeit it is in a back area.The one complaint I have with the entire pool set up is (and this happens far to much at resorts) is that people seemingly get up incredibly early to go out and reserve their lounge chairs. One morning I wondered down poolside at 7:45AM Note: the pool doesn't officially open until 8:00AM and there was virtually no chairs available as everyone had towels and in some cases bags/books reserving their particular spot for use later in the day. It was manageable but still the hotel needs to deal with this common problem better. (NOTE: true 5 Stars that we have stayed at do manage it)The rooms were more than adequate although we were in building four on the ground floor across from the elevator and housekeeping staff storage room. If you retire early expect to hear the elevator as the late night folks return to their rooms. Also in the morning the housekeeping staff show up around 7:45AM and tend to chat and make noise. I would NOT recommend anyone staying near the elevators in any building. The food was fine...not always 5 Star but more than acceptable. Our favourites were the Grill House and the Italian. I heard the lobster was iffy but if you go there the advice we heard was to order your lobster grilled. Anyone though who suggests that the food across the board is poor is either naive of all inclusives, expecting food of a $4000/week property including premium wines at half the price, incredibly picky or born to complain , aka they are likely people that are not happy unless they are unhappy!!!! The property doesn't have a lunch hut around the pool so you either have go to one of the restaurants (we usually went to the grill house near the pool area and had them make up hamburgers for take-out) but we quickly learned the hotel staff serve pizza pool side. Its quite good.Like all resorts if you take care of the serving staff by giving them a respectible tip (we tipped US$5-10/day) they will take care of you. Each day we had a smililng and attentive server happily bring us drinks poolside and in some cases without us even having to order. As I said, take care of them and they will definitely take care of you and it will make for a more enjoyable trip. Don't forget housekeeping, buffet and restaurant staff either.A recent article read in a Toronto Ontario daily newspaper praised the DR for raising the bar as a destination resort and indicated ther top three hotels and the Excellence was one of the top three. While I wouldn't call Excellence Punta Cana an all around 5 Star resort, for the money it is certainly a 4 Star with some aspects of the experience a 5 Star. Enjoy your vacation.

<Content>Great Honeymoon resort......but This was our first time to the Excellence. Great Honeymoon destination, landscaping on the resort was breathtaking. Overall the grounds including the pools were very well maintained. Great restaurants! Our favorites were Agave  Spice for dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast buffet at Tuscana. The service at the resort bars and restaurants was great as well. There was even a daily beach BBQ which we really enjoyed! They cooked something different for lunch each day right on the beach. Pizzas were also handed out on the beach and at the pools during certain times of the day. One day they even brought out fruit kabobs while we were laying on the beach. The shows were also good. We did not think we'd be into going to the shows, but the few we went to were great. They bring you a schedule of the shows and activities to your room each day so you can decide ahead of time if there is a show you would be interested in seeing. Plan ahead though because if you get there too late the seating is all taken. The included horseback riding was really nice although we do not recommend the ATV tour the resort offers for $80. Basically they take you to the outskirts of Punta Cana, which is very underdeveloped and the dirt roads are extremely bumpy! There is no reason to leave the resort on your own. From what we could tell, there is not much outside the resort and if you don't know your way around it has the potential to be shady. We also must say that the rooms need attention. At least ours did. Upon entering we were greeted with a very musty smell and many of the room amenities needed updating. The jacuzzi tub took 45 minutes to fill up and the refrigerator kept things cool at best. The service to the room could have been improved on as well. Our door would not lock at one point and they left us waiting an hour before someone came to fix it. Also, one night we had ants and it took an hour for someone to bring us bug spray. The room service takes at least an hour each time you order and you get the feeling you are bothering them when you do place an order. Our mini bar was filled once in the week we were there, and should have been filled daily. Luckily, you don't spend much time at all in your room, and once you leave your room you are welcomed by paradise so it doesn't matter as much. Overall, great experience. We would consider staying at an Excellence resort again.

<Content>Loved the Sax Music. Domingo Rules! Excellence Punta Cana lived up to its name in every way. The cleanliness and well organized and run community and outstanding service made the stay a wonderful experience. As an amateur alto sax player, I was awed by the artful, jazzy, virtuoso performance of Domingo, one of the gems performing at EPC. His easy going, friendly style and welcoming demeanor makes you instantly like him. And his mastery of the Tenor, Alto and E flat sax allow him to offer a wonderful range of standards both American and Latin, all with his incredibly masterful and melodic interpretation.

<Content>Loved the entire experience The resort was beautiful and well maintained. All members of the staff were friendly and helpful and always smiling. The entertainment staff, especially Inez, Caesar, Wainy, and Juan Carlos were so much fun. They were always willing to dance with me and show me new steps. All of the meals were delicious and the variety of drinks too numerous to name, but very tasty. All of the members of my party (20) had a great experience and days (and nights) of fun!!! The entire staff deserves a raise and lots of praise!

<Content>4th time and still 5 star to us Sorry for a late post. Me and my husband spent 10 days from Septmeber 3 to September 12. We go to Punta Cana 2 times a year. This is our 4th trip to Excellence and this was one of the best trips. When we arrived we were greated wiht a warm smile,drink and wisk away to the excellence club. to our suprise we where upgraded to an excellence ocean view suite. Beautiful room, the maid was great always leaving little towel figures and the the gentleman he stocked our fridge was great we ended up calling him KIT KAT man he was always leaving extra kit kats for my husband. Room service was great.The pool was wonderfull never had an issue with getting a bed or floats. Juan and felix are top notch service around the pool. Juan got to know us that when we where at the pool he knew what we drank and brought it to us very attentive.Food was good i am a picky eater but was able to find something to eat.If you get a chance and want to get gifts go over to judys she is on the right hand side of the resort on the beach. She does not hassel you we got alot of good gifts at a cheap price. She speaks very good english.If you are looking for a very romantic quiet place to be with the one you love this is the place. We do tip well when we are there, and we take school supplies,toys for the kids we give them to the maid. I always take gifts for the maid to lotions ,jelwery. They work very hard for very little. I feel lucky to be able to visit thier country and they are the nicest people you could meet. We are going back Feb 2009 cant wait.

<Content>A little piece of paradise Wow, what can I say. We flew back home to cold England today, and how I wish I was still there!Okay details;Flight and Airport Transfer - long flight bit squashed we used Thomas Cook, but bareable. The road from the airport to the hotel is bumpy yes but we had a lovely big airconditioned coach with good suspension, so it was all part of the adventure.Arrival - we got there and we were both standing with our mouths hung open with awe, the lobby is so beautiful, the pictures and website do not do it justice. We got the champagne and cold cloth and the girl said welcome home corny, but such a lovely touch. The staff were really friendly on the check in desk.Room - our first impression of the room was great, it looked beautiful, very clean and spacious, we were on the ground floor so had a little garden with a hammock and viranda, we overlooked a garden, it was just the lovliest thing to get there, sit out and crack open the first beer from the mini bar. We had a four poster bed and sunken jacuzzi, we also had a power shower seperately. Good tv and a dvd player. Room was cleaned every day, and mini bar restocked.Food - really good, great choice and really excellent quality. My favourite meal was lunch times in Toscana, loads of choice and all my favourites. They make up pasta for you there or fajitas, and there are tons of other things to try. Breakfast and dinner were great too. We tried all the restuarants except Lobster House and Barcelona, that was only because we didn't fancy anything on the menu. My favourite restuarants were Spice and Chez Isabel and the Grill. Steaks and shrimp were awesome! Service - Really good - staff were friendly, always smiling, or singing songs! Whether you tipped or not it didnt matter. We tipped when we thought it was appropriate. We had a couple of minor problems with things in the room, and overall they sorted these quickly without a fuss.Entertainment - this was better than I expected, some of it was naff, but we had fun anyway, the club on site is good fun, the casino was closed but they provided a shuttle to the resort nearby - we didn't go as it isnt our thing. The entertainment staff work very hard indeed. I noticed them hone in more on the Americans than the Brits, which was okay for us, quite bemusing actually. Kareoke was great fun, yes I got up and had a go!!Cleanliness - top notch, could not ask for more.Insects - we got bitten by ants!!! My other half got a couple of mozzie bites, but nothing bad. We eventually bought a can of Off from the chemist on site, cant say it really worked, best thing to do is buy some After Bite and take it to stop the itching.Beach - stunning, beautiful, we laid on one of the double bed things one day - bliss!! You don't get hassled and the bar guys come and ask if you want drinks. The sea is hard work. It was warm but the waves are relentless. Be careful and listen to the life guard.Pool- normally we are beach dwellers but we spent more time at the pool this time, probably as the sea was so choppy, the beds were more comfy round the pool and the you could just dip in and out of the water there. They have floats in the pool, they are a great idea. There is the usual silliness with reserving beds and hiding floats, but we didn't do it on any of the days and always got a bed and a float. The pool is absolutely lovely.Drinks - excellent, proper brands, cocktails are lovely! Measures are lethal, be careful!!! They are forever coming round and asking if you want a drink, you don't have to move a muscle if you don't want to!Weather - the forecast showed showers/clouds, and I was worried, but in reality, it was beautiful sunshine with the odd cloud burst, which was pretty welcome when it came. The nights are really warm, but we had good aircon in the room.Channel 21 on the tv - once you get there you'll know why I just had to mention this, every single bloke on the resort had something to say about this channel, turned them all into blushing 15 year olds - beware if you are easily offended!!! Excursions - we did not go on any, we just wanted to lay there and do nothing for two weeks, but other friends we met there did go to the Seona and the Outback trip, which they said was good. The shopping trip apparently is a bit of a waste of time.Safety - I felt completely safe on the resort, I was really relaxed about leaving my stuff unattended by the pool or whatever, don't take silly risks, but generally there is no need to worry. I would not fancy going off the resort on my own in terms of safety though.Overall - we had a wonderful time, we wish we were back there, its probably the best holiday I've ever had - and thats comparing it to the US, Dubai and the Med.Just have to mention the couples we met on hol - Brian and Trisha and Denise and Dave, thanks for making the delay on our last day a lovely little drinking session in the lobby! Was great to meet you.All I can say is if you are booked to go and like me you are scouring these reviews to make sure you've done the right thing - you have, I wish I was coming with you, you will love it!!!

<Content>The most spacticular Resort ever! Just returned from a week at the Excellence Hotel/Resort in Punta Cana, DR. What an appropriate name!!! We are from Charlottesville, Virginia.We had a fabulous time. The room was spectacular, folks at the desk were so accomodating, the Conseirge (Leticia) adopted us and took care of our every request.The food was far better than any cruise ship that we had been on before. No doubt because of Bert the German Head Chef ,keeping track of all seven restaurants.Entertainment every night was great-especially the after dinner music played by Domingo the sax player - like better than Kenny G !All in all it was a bargain-being an All Inclusive resort- air fare, food, accomodations,drinks, beach activities, horsebackriding on the beach,airport transfers, gratuities and, in general, just plain fun  relaxation.The bus ride from the airport to the hotel was quite an experience. Roads need lots of work..Plan to go-the weather was 75 in am and 86 in afternoons (Nov 7 - 14- 2008).We will never forget this one!

<Author>I_hate_working
<Content>Beautiful resort - Customer service lacked just a little bit Very Nice All Inclusive place. The resort itself is gorgeous, one of the nicer ones that I have seen throughout the Caribbean. Customer service was good, but not the best. They took care of all the major things and we had no big issues. Some of the small things, they didn't take care of. We called everyday to say our remote for the TV wasn't working, but nobody ever fixed it. Not a big deal because the only time the TV was on was when we were getting ready for dinner. A few nights we needed extra towels because housekeeping did not replace them. One night, the extra towels never came and we ended up using our pool towels. Again these were smaller issues, but for the most part everyone was great. Housekeeping would also make a lot of noise and it would start at 8AM, so if you like to sleep late, watchout! THE FOOD:The food was good, if you are expecting gourmet meals, you probably shouldn't go to an all inclusive :) That being said, the food was still very good and there were a few dishes that kept us coming back. THE RIDE THERE:AWFUL! No way around it. It took us 1 hour and that was only because we had a private transfer. Group transfers take 90 minutes. The road is EXTREMELY bumpy, so if you get carsick easily, hold off on the booze until you get to the resort!MOSQUITOS:Yes, they exist, but not nearly as bad as some of the reports I have seen on here. My wife and I probably had a total of 5-6 bites each over the 5 days we were there. ENTERTAINMENT:The nightly shows they had were great. Michael Jackson, Circus, etc. All of them worth watching. I would start heading to find a seat in the theater around 45 minutes before show time though as it does tend to get crowded. The Sax player, Domingo, was great. Definitely worth hearing. POOL AND BEACH:All very nice. It was nice we didn't have to go out early and reserve our chairs as there were plenty to go around. The servers were fairly consistent in providing beverages. At the pool in the afternoon, the resort hands out personal pizzas which is nice. All in all, we'd go back and recommend this place to our friends, but the customer service is not up to the standards of a Mexico or Jamaica. It was still good though.

<Content>Excellente! I've been reading reviews for Excellence Punta Cana for quite some time. Some of the reviews I read before going made me wonder if we made the proper choice. Some of the reviews that I read since returning home make me wonder if we were at the same place. The only thing I can say about the negative reviews is that they must come from people who just really hate life and need to have something to complain about to be content, or they just have really high standards. I'm sure if you constantly scrutinize a property, any property, you can always find something wrong with it. With people coming and going all the time, I'm sure no property is perfect. But . . . is it really worth wasting time and energy dwelling on it? Why not make the best of it? Yes, the roads are bumpy and it is a long ride from the airport. However, it is something to talk about and laugh about later on. I read that someone got bit by a duck. They are not tame animals! Even a dog will bite if provoked or having an off day. I read that there were bugs and cockroaches. It's a tropical island! We didn't see any bugs the entire time we were there, nor did we come home with bug bites. It's too bad that people feel they weren't treated properly. Has anyone ever heard that you reap what you sow? I saw some of the attitudes being directed at the waitstaff and housekeeping department. I saw people order room service and then leave before it arrived because the clock was wrong in their room. I saw people order food in restaurants that wasn't even on the menu and the staff bent over backwards to meet the request. We stayed at the Excellence Punta Cana from 11/7/08 through 11/14/08, and it was FABULOUS! We received champagne and cold cloths upon our arrival and were greeted with welcome home!. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome and pampered. If we did lack something, we called the concierge and it was taken care of immediately. They even follow up in a few hours or the next day to make sure we were satisfied. The food was excellent, not like at home, but isn't that the whole idea of getting away from home . . . to experience new things? The drinks flowed freely and often. We had no problem with any type of drinks (alcohlic or not) or service. Our experience was one we will remember and cherish forever. All of the employees and managers were 'Johnny-On-The-Spot'. It's sad that some people feel it necessary to not only ruin it for themselves but for others as well. As with the other reviews, this is only my opinion. And you know what they say about opinions!

<Content>Excellence is excellent My wife and I just got back from this resort. I'll try to be brief and to the point. It's a 10 out of 10 for sure in every way. Words can't describe just how wonderful the experience was. The staff treats all guests like royalty and there was not one exception to that. The resort is clean, it's in excellent condition with well manicured grounds and attention paid to the smallest of details. I am an incredible picky eater and I found the food in the 8 restaurants to be top notch with plenty of variety. The pools are clean and uncrowded. Service was way beyond what we expected. Never were we made to feel that an additional gratuity was expected for the great service. Never. We tipped a little here and there because of the extrordinary service just to show how much we appreciated the effort. It was not necessary however. I have been on 19 cruises. This was our best vacation ever. Finally we can say we went on a relaxing vacation. My wife and I agree that if you go to this resort and complain about anything then you are simply a complainer and unsatisfiable.  OK you force me to find some complaint. HHmmm... the ride from the airport I suppose was quite long and bumpy. Roads in Punta Cana leave a lot to be desired, but what does this have to do with Excellence? Nothing I suppose. Go Go Go You won't be dissapointed. If you are, then when you get home take big suck pill because you are incurable and you may as well put yourself out of your misery and spare us all at the same time.

<Content>Beyond Excellence!! I don't have adequate words to describe this outstanding place!! My husband and I went to EPC from 10/31/08 - 11/05/08 for our 17th wedding anniversary. We could not have been more pleased!! This place is heaven on earth!!! We just sat in awe of how beautiful this entire place is. The beach is beyond beautiful. The sand is as soft as powder and the water is just so relaxing to sit and watch. It is very rough, please don't be fooled by its beauty. We frequently go to the Jersey shore so I thought nothing of the reviews of how rough the sea was, until I got in. Wow, it knocked me over without any warning. Be careful. Enjoy the shallow water and watch your back. The waves change without any warning. This did not in any way change our thoughts on this marvolous place!! We could not have chosen a better place to vacation. The people that work here are the nicest people on the planet!! They are always smiling and ready to meet your every wish. We stayed in an Excellence Club junior suite garden view. We were more than happy with our room. Robert  Carlos, from the Excellence Club went out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible!! Thank you both for an outstanding vacation!! The upgrade to the Excellence Club is worth every penny. They are at your beck and call whenever you need them. The service from everyone was outstanding!! The food choices are more than expected. If you cannot find something you like, I would be suprised! I asked my husband about our 3rd day there if he was suprised that I hadn't complained about anything yet? (I'm known to be a bit picky) I could not find one thing to complain about!! We read all the reviews before we left and were a little worried. Don't be!!!! I can say without hesitation that this is the best vacation we've ever had!! My only regret is that our stay was not longer!! The Excellence Punt Cana is a place you must experience for yourself!! Words cannot do justice to such a magistical place!! Go and enjoy!!!!!! We cannot wait to go back!!! To say we loved it is an understatement!!!!!

<Content>Poor Management-NO WAY it's even Fair vs. Excellence Go to Secrets. Excellence has deteriorated under new mgt. Visited Secrets Excellence Punta Cana 6yrs ago and it was FABULOUS, then went to Secrets Capri Mexico 4yrs ago-again Terrific. Excellence new mgt has allowed maintenance to suffer-old fixtures with lime build up, broken toilets, very poor upkeep on maintenance. Housekeeping mgt also is to blame for allowing the hard working housekeepers to keep their carts everywhere...pull them into the rooms, we don't want to walk around these things, we saw many dirty rags drying on the balcony's, dirty mop buckets, no towels ever to dry your hands, no toilet paper rolls so tp is soggy at the pool/beach bathrms., elevators never been cleaned and used by mini bar stock staff so carts of dirty/clean glasses everywhere, scuff marks covered the walls. The food was awful, all pre-prepared so old, never get your order right, no music, open til 10:30PM but either don't take you after 9:30PM and by 10PM stop piano and turn off A/C to push you out the door. Same buffet for breakfast/lunch/desserts-recycle old food. All 4 of us had major stomach issues keeping us in the bathroom the entire stay---perfectly well the first day home so it was the food. The Dominican Dinner outside was done very nice but the food was gross...they served RAW chicken and shrimp skewers...I kept telling the cook I didn't want it yet, it wasn't cooked, I could see pink (it was dark outside!) and shrimp still blue on one side...he just laughed at me when I pulled my plate away. Well that night at the Circus show we saw many people running to the bushes throwing up. We couldn't eat more than half our meals and survived on Oreos and pizza...gross, we wanted fillet, lamb, duck. So the Maintenance Dir, Housekeeping Dir and Restaurant Dir need to be fired. The landscaping crew do an amazing job keeping up and it shows, the grounds are prestine-so the GroundsKeeping Supervisor is doing his job very well. We were SHOCKED that this vacation did not meet our expectations and tried to speak with the GM who never took my meetings and wasted too much of my time explaining our disappointments. Our friends never got a champagne welcome and we didn't get cool cloths...no biggie but if you pride yourself on committing to your services...come through. I wrote we were repeat guest and I was assured our upgraded ocean view rm would be great...we moved in 15min b/c I was looking at 2 bldgs and no ocean. rooms never ready by 3PM chk in. Pools close at 6PM-Why??? No towels by 11AM and again none replaced at 4PM-I told a Mgr at 4PM we needed towels, just returned from horseback for a refreshing swim ...he never brought us towels. Cascade Pool has no cocktail server so dirty glasses and water bottles everywhere...disgusting. They lost attention to detail and quality service and food-Excellence Mgt is to blame not the hard workers who take direction. Be expected to be ignored, get diarrhea, eat nothing, air dry your hands after the bathroom and air dry at the pool, get your own drink.GM-you are running this beautiful place into the ground-shame on you for collecting a paycheck.

<Content>Good times all around I really think some people must have stayed at a different hotel then we did. We stayed at the resort from Oct. 29th to Nov. 5th, and we had a wonderful time. While I would not rate the experience a Five Star event, I would give it Four Stars. Here are some of our takes on the stay:Restaurants: Advice, if you go open air, go later in the evening, when it is cooler. The restaurants are open until 11:00, so go late if you are too hot.The Grill is open air, but my wife thought here ribeye was the best meal she had all week. We ate there the last night we were there. I ordered the Mixed Grill. Way too much food. Two steaks, a pork chop and a chicken breast. Spice: I really liked the Japanese seafood curry and my wife liked the tempura shrimp. The sushi was average, but good. The rice appeared a bit sticker than fresh, but the seafood was great on it. We had the combo and the Maki  nagimi. I don鈥檛 think anything on those two appetizers was even raw. The salmon was smoked. Chez Isabelle: We ordered off their special menu that was inside the regular menu. We both had the鈥?um, I don鈥檛 speak French and my spell check is not helping me here鈥hey Chatuebrion (steak). It was two large slices perfectly cooked and tender as can be. Toscana: We ate breakfast here and an occasional lunch. It is buffet style. Edger makes a great omelet. Lunch there was also buffet and ok.Barcelona: Never ate there.Oregano: Pizza is good. The cheese is a little more pungent than the US, but good. Agave: Outdoor restaurant that is in a Spanish style courtyard, so there is no breeze. It was hot, but tolerable. Go later if you want it to be cooler. We ate there the second night and we had not learned to eat later in the evening if we were open air. Lobster House: We ate there the first night. It was ok, The lobster was a bit overcooked, but I liked it. I ordered the spicy version, which I was told was 鈥渕uy calliente,鈥?but it was mild at best. There was really nothing too spicy served in the whole place.Pool: Loved it. We got there when the place was about 65% occupied, so we never had an issue finding a place to lay our towels. I am an early riser, so I would stake out a cabana layout each morning. I鈥檇 say, if you want one of those, 8:30 is the latest you鈥檇 get one. There are also beds with slotted covers almost always available. It is humid and hot, but a quick jump in the pool and you鈥檙e good to go. Water Volley ball was fun too. It was at the pool by the Santa Domingo area at 11:00 and 3:00 every day. Also, every day, about 12:30 to 1:00 a gentleman walks around with pizzas for anyone to have. They are little鈥?.8-10 inchers and good. There is also little containers of food at the bars (finger sandwiches and fruit).At 12:30, every day, they also cook on the beach. It is usually not ready until 1:00, but they had hamburgers, a white bratwurst-kind of sausage, there version of chorizo and chicken two or three times we were there. They also had鈥rap, I am butchering a languageBeach: A lot cooler than the pool area, as the breeze is not buffered. We never laid out there, but walked it. Vendors: The venders on property are extremely pushy. If they offer you $50 on some item, it is probably worth $17-20, so bargain. Also, there are huts at the end of the beach, after building 15. It is 20 feet from the pool. Nancy鈥檚 is the best, in my opinion. You don鈥檛 really get to bargain with her, but that is because her prices are already better than anyone else鈥檚. There is also a fake Target, Wal-mart and Shop-for-less huts. We bought a sarong at Shop-for-less for $18 and got the exact one, in a different color from Nancy for $11. So, my suggestion is to go there. Also, the more you buy from her the better the prices get. Sunscreen: Bring it. Where it. We met another couple, from NY, who stated they had never burned in their lives, so they did not bring sunscreen. They bought it after day two. Bug spray: On Tuesday night they do a Dominican Republic night on the beach, with all the local foods and such. They have bug spray for you when you walk into the area, if you want. My wife only put on a little bit in the room, as she had no bug bites all week, thinking she was safe. We had to leave the dinner after 10 minutes here feet were getting so eaten alive. She got five bug bites in that 10 minutes. So, the beach and the Sports bar you need to wear it a lot. In general, maybe a squirt or two.It was a great time. We loved it and would return to the hotel. You just make of it what you want to make of it. If you want to be angry or frustrated, then you will be. If you want to have a great time and can overlook this or that, then you will have a great time. 飦?br/>I hope this helps. Dave

<Content>Perfect for our Honeymoon! My husband and I chose the Excellence Punta Cana for our honeymoon, and it definitely did not disappoint! We did a lot of research on the different resorts in Punta Cana, and Excellence seemed to have everything we were looking for and it was also the most well-reviewed Punta Cana resort on all the travel sites we looked at. I'll try to be as thorough as possible in reviewing all aspects of our trip.We stayed for 6 nights/5days in October 2008. We connected from LA via Miami, and had no problems getting into the country. It was a breeze moving through Customs there - you pay $10 to get a tourist card, which once you get you just hand over to the next official, so its just a fee for entering the country. Have your Customs form filled out and your $10 ready and you're all set! Right after Customs you come into an area packed with bellhops (for lack of a better word), who all jockey for position to help everyone arriving. We told our guy who our shuttle company was (Prieto Tours, recommended hen you book through American Express), he took our luggage and got us right over to their desk. We were then ushered right out to the waiting shuttle bus, and although we did have a bit of a wait before we got moving, it was a large tour bus, air-conditioned and very comfortable. Our bus driver and guide were both very nice and informative, giving us a few tips on the ride there. The ride to the hotel took about 75 minutes, and was definitely not as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be. I guess it depends on which shuttle/taxi you take; although our bus was very nice, large, and newer, there were some sorry-looking ones at the airport as well. Yes, its a long drive, and the road was often bumpy and winding, but we were very comfortable and I enjoyed taking in the scenery. The road takes you through at least 2 towns, giving you also a glimpse of the local life in the DR. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted with smiles and champagne! We splurged on the Excellence Club, which in my opinion was definitely worth it, for reasons I will detail later. Because of this, we were escorted straight to the Excellence Club for check-in. There we were given a tour of the Excellence Club, some information regarding our stay and what to expect, and then taken to our room. The concierge was so nice, helpful, and accomodating throughout our stay. Our room was clean and comfortable throughout our stay, although the bed was definitely harder than I prefer. Housekeeping would come twice a day (once in the morning and once for turn down) and our mini bar was also re-stocked twice a day even though we didn't need it replenished that often. They also give you a newsletter each night detailing the activities going on the next day, which restaurant is closed, and the weather report. The only issue I had was getting some bites on my feet and ankles on the second night - and the only thing we could attribute them to was something in the bed, because I slept underneath the covers but my husband slept on top of them, and he wasn't bitten at all. I got a few more throughout our stay, but they were just red bumps and never hurt or itched or bothered at all, so I'm not sure what they came from.October must be a slow time for the resort, because it wasn't crowded at all and we never once had problems with getting a good spot by the pool or on the beach, and never had to wait at any restaurant or very long for drinks. People were out early claiming chairs by the pool, but that seemed unnecessary because there was always more than enough to go around. I love the fact that this resort is adults only! Which also meant it was mostly couples, which gave the entire atmosphere a safe, calm, and relaxing vibe. Our favorite spot was right by the swim-up bar - definitely our favorite bar! The bartender was awesome and made all our favorite drinks and anything we requested, and we had fun trying out new ones (ask for the Sammy Sosa or a Coco Loco!). I'm not a big drinker because I generally don't like the taste of alcohol, but the drinks were made so well I could hardly even tell they had alcohol (which I knew they did because I watched him mix them up!). We spent most of our days in and around the pool at the swim-up bar, and a few times we went over to the beach in the afternoons. The beach was gorgeous and I loved napping on the beds. The water was warm but the waves were so strong that not too many people ventured out. I think this could have been because it was still in hurricane season, so I'm not sure if htey are like that all the time. There were certain areas marked off to not go into, and just one small area that was safer but still warned against because of the strength of the waves. We had a good time just watching people get knocked down, including my husband who thought he could dominate the waves.The food was good, sometimes great, nothing outstanding. For breakfast and lunch you are limited in the options; we went to Toscana every day and had the buffet. I think the Lobster House was also open with lighter breakfast options, and The Grill was open for lighter lunch options. They did try to change up the buffet options but we definitely had had enough of it by the time we left. Because we were eating at Toscana every day for breakfast and lunch, we never tried it for dinner. There are seven restaurants at the resort and each night one of them is closed. No reservations needed for any of them. Some of them do have dress codes that they do enforce, however. Ladies can get away with more, but be sure to bring some nicer dresses, pants, and dressy sandals. For men most of the places required pants, collared shirts, and shoes. Each one is a different cuisine and they all have rather limited menus. The first night we went to the Lobster House, where lobster is really the only thing on the menu and you can choose how you want it cooked and what side dish you want. It was decent, but not good enough to want to go back. Agave is the Mexican place, and the only thing I liked there were the chips and guacamole, although my husband liked his entree. Spice is Asian, and was perfect for a lighter meal, we both really enjoyed it and it was the only place we went twice. Chez Isabelle is French cuisine and my husband and I agreed that it was the best complete meal we each had. We didn't go to Barcelona (Mediterranean) or The Grill. Room service is also available, and we did order something on our last night but it never came!But the service was great everywhere. All of the staff, waiters, hostesses, bartenders, etc were so friendly, courteous, accomodating and helpful. They all spoke at least a little English, so communicating was never an issue for us. We followed the advice of some other reviewers and just brought $100 in $1 bills, and used that all week for tipping. Everyone really appreciated the tips and you could tell they weren't always expecting it. We also spent a few nights at the Sports Bar after dinner, although never for very long because it's outdoors and would get very humid and the bugs were pretty thick there. There are a few pool tables, foosball tables, and ping pong, and some big TV screens for watching sports. Its a smaller bar but they also had various snack items available each night (popcorn, nachos, chicken wings).We were glad we went for the Excellence Club, because that gave us free internet use and access to the Excellence lounge, which was always stocked with beverages and lighter food options all throughout the day. There is also a TV up there and bar service, so it was more comfortable to hang out there than at one of the outdoor bars. We didn't do any of the extra activities they offer, like horseback riding, but they are available. The casino in the resort was closed for maintenance, but they were offering a free shuttle to a nearby resort if you wanted to gamble. The nightly entertainment was sometimes entertaining (Michael Jackson show was pretty funny) and sometimes too painful to watch (karaoke). Overall, the Excellence Punta Cana was a wonderful choice and we would definitely go back. The best points for me are its all-inclusive and adults-only, the location is perfect and the staff was awesome. I would highly recommend Excellence! Please feel free to contact me if you would like any further detail on anything!

<Content>Bueno not Excellente After coming off an awesome honeymoon at Excellence Riviera Maya last year, my husband  I decided to try Excellence Punta Cana this year. We kinda wished we just went back to Mexico. Let me just start off by saying we are NOT picky New Yorkers by any means. Although the resort is beautiful and I being a beach person, thought the beach was more tropical and gorgeous here, the standards of the hotel and service were much lower. Upon arrival, our room was in building 14 (the very left end and last building of the resort) very far walk from anything. Not that much of a bother to us though. We had a wonderful view of the ocean from that building. Although these rooms were smaller than the ones in Mexico.The problem with the room was COCKROACHES. We killed 4 the 1st day. We insisted on being moved to another building but couldn't be accommodated until the second day. They sent up a can of raid to spray everywhere.The next morning I woke up with bug bites all over my legs. I know this is a tropical country and I was prepared with bug spray and all, but I still couldn't get over the amount of bites I had in the course of a week. I'm home 4 days and still have marks. Although they didn't seem to like my husband. So maybe it's something with the women?!After moving to our second room in building 6, more directly in the middle of the resort, but with less of an ocean view (at this point we really didn't care) I had asked the front desk on 3 occasions to bring us a coffee maker and ironing board. We never received either all week. The restaurants are the same as the other resort except that Spice in Punta Cana did not have a hibachi grill room set up like they had in Mexico. Not a big deal, just wondered why this was. The food menus were pretty much the same, not much to complain about or rave about. Everything seemed just ok. We were disappointed that the casino was closed. The casino they offer to take you to at Sirinis (next hotel over) had 3 tables and was very boring. We looked forward to meeting people and playing a daily game of Texas Hold Em like we had last year, though there was no such thing on the entertainment slip here :(The entertainment crew will to get you into activities and we did do a few that were fun - I must complain about the music they play everyday on the beach drove us nuts! It's the same tracks over and over and over. I for one like to listen to the waves and relax. A little music for a little while is ok, but by the second or third day we started to realize this was all they had - OMG Take an IPOD! Vendors come on site 3 nights a week and all they do is hassle you when you walk by. What a pain in the [--]. We had to try to walk around the beach to get to our room and avoid them or jump in the pool and swim away! They put a necklace on you and ask you what you like, what you want to pay for it and wrap it up and let you take it before you pay them. I mean its good in a way if you are looking to bargain and buy stuff but there is duty free at the airport going home. Same $hit. They are just really annoying. We bought a few things form one of the vendors on the beach. So yeah be careful when you take a walk to the left or to the right. They come right down to the water and try and get your business.I hate having to write so much in a review that sounds so negative, but I want to be honest. We pay enough for a vacation and I was open to reading previous opinions. My husband got severely ill halfway through the trip with high fever, major stomach issues and cramping. I've never seen him so sick before. Cost him 2 days of our trip. He believes it was from brushing your teeth in the sink from the tap water. That or maybe bad ice. They tell you the ice is safe, but you never know. I started feeling sick the morning we were leaving and got hit with the same illness our first night home. Just started feeling better today. Lasted 3 days for me. I just thank god I was home already! It really was awful and painful.I'm not even going to talk about the ride to and from the airport. I was already prepared from reading about it on trip advisor - and seriously I thought New York potholes were bad after a harsh winter - you have no idea! Sad to see how poor and dirty the country is too because it really is beautiful.To sum up, the beach was beautiful, the grounds were beautiful, the gym was modern, the entertainment was fun, the birds hanging around were cool to play and take pics with (warning stay away from the big white ducks) One shot out of no where and bit me hard on my leg. I still have a bruise from that little effer!If you came to this resort 1st you would think it was excellent, but if you went to Mexico already - your standards and expectations will be too high for this resort. We'll be going back to Mexico! Sorry Punta Cana.

<Content>Would love to go back for my honeymoon! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights and since we were staying the country for another 4 days we almost stayed an extra night at the Excellence resort. We decided not to do that so we can look forward to next time.As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the bell hops with glasses of champagne. Matias, greeted us at the reception desk and our welcome was so impressive we did not need a lot of convincing to upgrade to the Excellence Club service they provide. Gerson took our luggage to our room with a mini tour of the restaurants and information of what to expect and what to do if we needed anything at all. After speaking to Ricardo at the Excellence Club lounge we were guided again by Gerson to our room. I had not seen the rest of the hotel or truly experienced the service and I was already feeling like a queen! The room was amazing. Everything that you expect from a top resort and more. The bed was beautifully made, everything was sparkling, clean. I highly recommend staying at this hotel. It is a very romantic place to stay if you want to propose to your significant other, celebrate an anniversary or for your honeymoon. There was a few couples getting married at the hotel while we were there. My boyfriend and I loved the service! The entertainment was fantastic and everyone was sooo friendly it made you feel very comfortable. This place really makes you completely forget about all your worries. The first night there we ate dinner at Spice and it was amazing. After dinner we headed to Kafe Kafe near the beach and had a great time with Jose, the bartender. The next day we decided to play Volleyball at the beach and Mariel played with us since none of the other guests were playing at the time. We also went bike riding with her. She also made our experience even better by being so friendly. Edgar, one of the cooks at Toscana, where we ate breakfast and lunch, was very friendly as well. The food was delicious. The last night there the hotel had a special dinner on the beach and it was the best Dominican food I have eaten and I have eaten a lot of Dominican food because I am Dominican. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time we highly recommend this place and would love to go back. In fact we are planning to return for our next anniversary!!

<Content>I've Got To Go Home? Weather co-operated 95%. Mid Oct wrong way Hurricane allowed us to fly in, high surf, more than gentle on shore breezes, but tolerable. Next 5 days were spectacular. Ride in?? Not great. Ride out?? Worse driver, worse experience. Stay?? - you won't want to go home. Let the rum flow, eat, enjoy the sunshine and all the new friends you can meet. Room was great, first floor by Blue, swim out, swim up. Staff was terrific. Wife and I enjoyed it. Will look into Excellence resorts again, definitely. A MUST take along an insulated MUG, wide bottomed and low profile, great for filling at the closest bar and floating the pools with, stays colder longer and won't spill. You will be the envy of the crowd.

<Content>Wonderful as always My wife and I have stayed at the Excellence Resorts in both Mexico and Punta Cana and as always enjoy Punta cana. The staff in the excellence club are top notch and each visit they have continued to impress. Ricardo Cedano assisted us with check in and check out and any want that we had in between. Everything was handled very professionally. We decided on the helicopter to take us out, last minute, Ricardo handled everything and made sure that our check out and departure was perfect. The grounds and food were very good and although the beach was rough at the time, we still enjoyed the water on a couple of days. The pool and swim up bar are always great anyway. I would highly recommend visiting the Excellence and look up Ricardo in the Excellence Club if you get a chance.

<Content>Very pleasant for couples who want just a beach  My wife and I vacationed there Wednesday 10/29-11/02. The resort is beautiful, the landscaping and beach were beautiful, and bless their hearts, the service was very, very, good. Our bed was pretty spartan, but our room (jr. suite) was very nice, with an ocean view. The meals were nice, we ate two nights at Spice with mixed results on service, but had a very nice Chateau Briand at the French restaurant. The breakfast buffet is visually beautiful, but quite frankly there were foods and fruits put out that weren't that great--for example tangerines had good color, but were inedible. I tried pancakes one morning, but it was the same griddle for omelets (not near hot enough). It is obviously quite challenging to staff a resort with a 5-star reputation with a shortage of knowledgeable people--but they really are friendly and I believe are sincerely trying to do their best. The master chef has some very interesting dishes and is quite visible going from restaurant-to-restaurant keeping things in top shape.There is not that much to do except drink and do the beach, and you don't want to leave the property, believe me. The waves/surf are not suitable for snorkeling, or just a relaxing dip--it's damn rough. One afternoon, I thought I saw 20' waves breaking about a half mile out. We went SCUBA diving on to San Catalina island off La Romana, a nearly 2 hour bus ride--but it is a scenic drive to see agriculture in the DR (for me). The dive was very nice, we did The Wall and the Aquarios and the visibility was excellent. There aren't large fish on the reef, but there's not much current either. The dives were comparable to those off Grand Cayman--but it's quite aways from the resort. Friends told us that the Punta Cana area was their favorite in the Caribean, and I believe we were at it's best resort. That said, we may not return and check out another island for (1) beaches that permit more than just sunning, (2) closer SCUBA diving, and (3) more to do than just drink Presidente beer (which was pretty good), but when you're drinking quite a bit, it's hard to tell what digestive disorders are attributable to the alcohol or the food. Bottom line--it's a BEAUTIFUL facility, and the staff really go out of their way to do their best. If you want sun, relaxation, privacy--this is the place for you.

<Content>Honeymoon with the Brits! We just returned from our honeymoon at the Excellence. The resort exceeded our expectations! The rooms were very nice and well maintained. The lazy river pool was great! It provided plenty of space for guesta and lounge chairs. The pool itself was clean and just the right temperature. The drinks were good quality and never had trouble finding a bar. The night time entertainment was quite good, especially the Michael Jackson show! I can't say enough about the food! For an all inclusive resort the meal choices were excellent and quality of the meals was superb. This resort was perfect for a relaxing honeymoon! To top it all off, we met some fantastic people from the U.K. that we had a blast with!!!

<Content>Excellent, loved it! Secrets Excellence made a perfect honeymoon - lovely food, endless amounts of champagne, rum cocktails etc along with a big hot tub in your room!We were greeted with champagne and towels as we got there and settled into our large room very quicky. The bus trip from the airport was very rough so we got the helicopter back which was well worth it!The hotel's private beach was lovely and it was great fun to boogie board. Waves were too choppy to do much else. Weather in July was mixed, mainly sunny but a few storms.Entertainment was ok but we weren't there for that so didn't care. Restaurants were all great but could have done with more variety with a la carte menus. Spa was excellent and made great use of the gym and classes too.There wasn't much to do outside your resort so 14 nights is a bit long but it was our honeymoon after all so wasn't complaining!

<Content>Great resort We decided to ignore the few negative reviews and spent Oct 18-26 at the Excellence. Here are my random comments and suggestions that may not have been mentioned by others:Don't worry about the ride from the airport.Mosquitoes are not a problem. Bring one can of spray for when you plan to explore the gardens or enjoy the Dominican Day dinner on the beach.The food is excellent. We skipped the Lobster House and Oregano. The others were great. Never had to wait. Never had a need for Room Service. There's also a daily cookout on the beach, and sandwiches and fruit at some of the bars.Can't say enough about the booze.Don't miss the Michael Jackson show. Get there 1 hr early. Sit near the middle because the stage lighting fixtures obscure some of 'Michael's' awesome footwork. Also see the 鈥渃ouples鈥?show with guest participation - ours was hilarious.After every show, the cast is available for photos.We didn't go for the Excellence Club package. I suggest you don't book it in advance. When you check in, have them explain exactly what you would get if you upgrade, and for how much. If interested, you may be able to bargain.Sign up for the free horseback ride early; if it gets canceled by rain you can still make another one later in the week.We left $2 daily for the maid, even though service was erratic (I think this is due to the layout of the buildings; they can't keep checking rooms to find ones that are empty). Since we asked for diet soda (Coke Light) in the room fridge, we twice left a $2 tip next to it for the refiller person. There's a 3-piece roving band at two of the restaurants; gave them $3 total each time; I suspect they get little or nothing from the hotel. Occasional $1 to those who brought us drinks during the show at the theater. The only other tip we gave was $25 on our final day to Alta, the waitress who brought us endless drinks on the beach. There was never any pressure to tipBring a refrigerator magnet. It may trick the sensor on the balcony door so that you don't have to keep closing it to keep the AC on.Wireless Internet access worked okay in the room and on the beach, but was slow. Internet access ($5 for 20 min.) is available a short walk from the rooms.The grounds are beautiful. Ponds, fountains, statues, birds of all types including parrots, one of which plucked a button from my shirt (they also like eyeglasses). Once we even saw a peacock in the lobby.Lots of exercise equipment at the rec center. There's 4 TV's. If there's no attendant available, you can change channels with the control hidden on the right side.It you'd like to use a laptop or other AC-powered appliance on the balcony, bring an extension cord of 12 feet or longer. Also, all of the outlets are taken up by lamps, TV, etc. Bring one of those 1-to-3 adapter thingamajigs. American plugs work fine. Snorkeling at the hotel beach and the neighboring beach is poor due to the waves and swirling sand. Don't bother to bring your own gear unless you plan to take an off-premise excursion.We had two short power outages at night, and one loss of water pressure. No big thing. Use a battery-powered alarm clock or watch if you need to get up early. As always when traveling, clear out the room safe on the night before departure so that you won't have a major problem if there's no electricity in the morning.There's a small duty-free shop at the airport. If you have to change planes, remember that bottles of liquid cannot be taken through security.Don't climb on the lifeguard stand to get a good photo. I broke a step and almost killed myself. Totally my fault.It can be difficult to get a float at the pools. Selfish people tend to grab one early and stash it with their stuff all day. I wish the hotel would adopt a 鈥渄o not remove from water鈥?policy.Some also hoard those beds on the beach, but since it's hard to read while lying on one, we didn't use them even when available.Final suggestion: go, eat, drink, relax, enjoy.

<Content>What a trip!!!! We just arrived home from our fabulous vacation last week. After a horrible start to our vacation, we certainly made up for it at the Excellence, Punta Cana. We had a 6 hour delay in Miami due to engine problems with the plane. After arriving at the airport in Punta Cana at approximately 8:00 p.m. (we were supposed to be there by 3:00 p.m.), we were taken on a bus (Caribe) to the resort. You must be very careful at the airport because people are coming at you from all directions to get your luggage. You must be quite stern about where you want your luggage to go. The bus ride was a ride from Hell. You definitely need a massage after this trip! The roads are not paved. They have potholes like you have never seen before!!! Arrival at the hotel was at approximately 9:30 p.m. and we were literally beat! We had a quick dinner at the Lobster House and a quick drink and hit the sack!The next day was breathtaking in daylight!! The grounds are so beautiful and the room also was very nice (and very clean). We explored and had breakfast. The food was awesome. The only thing the Dominicans can't cook is steak. The steaks are so much better in the U.S. My husband was deperate to come home to a nice steak. However, the food was tremendous other than the beef.We did get sick though. We did not drink the water out of the taps. We only drank the water in the bottles. However, we still got the runs. Maybe from ice. Who knows! It certainly did not ruin the vacation.The Staff are the nicest people you will ever meet -- especially Jose at the Cafe Cafe. He's the bartender. What a character!My only problem is that it is over, and we are back to the same old stuff. I guess we have to work in order to go on another fabulous trip. I can't wait. You certainly will not be disappointed with your choice of Excellence, Punta Cana. HAVE FUN.Anne and Brian

<Author>lknight26
<Content>Enjoyed our trip, but we won't be back! Let me start off by saying they we were a group of 6 staying in building 4. This was my second trip to Punta Cana and 1st trip to EPC. My first trip in 2006 we stayed at the Gran Bahia Punta Cana and loved it! Overall we had a good vacation. While EPC is a beautiful resort with an amazing staff, I can say upfront that we will not return. They do try to do their best, but when you are charging top dollar more needs to be done to make sure things are ran smoothly and more consistent. Several of my same complaints were consistent with others that we met while we were there. My main point is this, while no vacation is perfect and problems can rise anywhere, when you charge what they charge, you definitely need to step up your game. I felt EPC dropped the ball too many times. While some issues may appear minor, that鈥檚 half the problem. It鈥檚 so minor that it鈥檚 aggravating that it鈥檚 not fixed. Again, we made the best of everything and I must say with that attitude we still had a fabulous time. I have no regrets for picking this place. But in all fairness I do feel the need to offer my honest opinion of how MY stay was. I too can now understand how two families can have two totally different vacation experiences at the same hotel/resort. The Good stuff:Staff is outstanding and they try their hardest to please everyone.The Spa was awesome and so was the staff. We did the couples ritual and it was AMAZING let me tell you!The drinks were very good and they offered pretty good quality liquor.The resort itself is very beautiful and clean. While the beach is a little rough, we still found it very relaxing to just lay out at the beach for the day.The Pools were very relaxing and refreshing (especially the cascading pool). Another of our favorite spots. The food overall was actually pretty good especially Spice and Toscana. The lobster house on the other hand is horrible. I鈥檓 not even sure you can call that lobster that they served. No wonder there was ever a wait to eat here. Pure hot mess!The mozzies were out and hungry, but we did fine with only 5 or 6 bites. They do a pretty good job spaying every evening.Not so good stuff:Everyone in my group got sick and still is 5 days later. Not sure what it was, but thank god we brought Imodium and pep to bismol with us, almost OD on it (lol). But again, we are all still suffering from stomach cramps, diarrhea, and nausea and its 5 days out. Giving it one more day before I head to my PCP. Air conditioning in the rooms was a MAJOR problem for me. They turn it off at night and this to me is completely unacceptable. I didn鈥檛 pay for partial air. I had my air on the snow flakes icon and it never rose above 80 degrees. Do you know how hot, sticky, and humid it gets in Punta Cana? Maintenance had to be called 3 times to my room, but it did no good since the problem is they turn it off at night (lol) . . Go figure. Personally speaking, I don鈥檛 go on vacation to sweat at the beach AND in my room too. So unless air not included in my rate (which it is) then please keep the air running throughout the night as well. Otherwise FULLY disclose this to guest prior to them booking, so they can choose if they would like to stay elsewhere. And the mini bar was no better, doesn鈥檛 keep anything cold. We didn鈥檛 bother using it since everything stayed so warm. We just asked the housekeeper to bring ice in the room at turn down and we soaked our beverages there.Our room was pretty dated. Not sure where the million dollar renovation was done at, but it wasn鈥檛 done to the rooms or at least my room 4008. I had TONS of rust at the base of the shower and IN the Jacuzzi. The shower head in my room broke as well on day 3. The maid just laid the head on the shower floor and we just made due with this for the rest of the week. While the room was musty at first, I brought my fbreeze plug in and that did the trick so no complaints on the odors. Housekeeping was very inconsistent. Only got face towels on the first day. Everyday after that, I had to call to request them. Not quite sure what the problem is, but another minor issue that needs to be fixed. We鈥檇 get several big towels just no face towels. I even went looking on the maids cart to avoid having to call again, but the carts had no face towels either.Anniversary Package: I emailed Elvira several months (as well as a week prior) to confirm ALL the details of this. It took 3 trips to concierge to finally get all our stuff two nights before we left. Guest the 3rd time requesting it was a charn. However, a slight bummer considering we were celebrating our anniversary the day we arrived. My thought would be: don鈥檛 offer an amenity if no one wants to follow through on it. In conclusion, your vacation is what you make of it. We made the best of it and therefore we had a nice time minus the hiccups. I just don鈥檛 see how you can charge $300+ a night and not provide guest with consistent basic amenities such as face towels, a decent cooling system, etc. I was just amazed at how these minor issues were even present at a resort like this. Totally unexpected! So after all the phone calls and trips to the front desk to get things fixed, we felt it was too much of a hassle when paying these prices. I鈥檇 rather deal with these problems (if I have to) by staying elsewhere, yet paying a 1/3 (if not 1/2) the price.

<Content>Excellente Resort-Welcome Home!! What a wonderful experience from arriving at the resort and being welcomed home to check-out 11 days later. Absolutely no problems with anything. As we had been at other Excellence Resorts, we were upgraded to a third floor room overlooking the cascading pools and mountains - unbelievable view!!! Ate at most of the restaurants and ate three times at Agave, two times at Toscano and two times at Spice - great food. Had the couples beach massage by Amarylis and Santa - money well spent. Weather was beautiful and only sprinkled a few times. It usually rained during the night. Domino, the sax/clarinet player, was amazing - also bought his two CD's. Did horseback ride for the half hour and had a fun time. Met some great people and would like to say hi to Mike/Nancy, Michelle/Harry, Allison/Buzz, Julie, Jack, John and Denise!!! We had no problems with mosquitos as they sprayed every night. We were able to deal with the vendors in front of the resort-just tell them what you will pay-they will either accept or deny. Shows were good - there was a lot of talent on the stage. The staff was always polite and many remembered our names and even the chef came and spoke with us during our romantic dinner at Chez Isabelle - nice touch - thank you. We loved the beach barbeques for lunch as well as the pizza being delivered poolside. Again, would recommend this resort to anyone with no reservations. Delaware Pair!!!

<Content>Absolutely Amazing Excellence Punta Cana was an amazing all inclusive resort. The staff was always friendly and always had a smile on their face. If you had a question you could talk to anyone and they were always willing to help you even if they had to go out of their way to do it. The staff was also pretty much fluent in english, and if they didnt know what you were saying they were able to figure it out (but that happened maybe once and it was our fault with our lingo).They have so much to do here.. We were never bored and their shows were awesome and so entertaining. The food at all the restaurants was great and you had a wide variety to choose from. you will not feel that you are being hounded or watched. you can go here and truly relax and enjoy yourself. The water in the ocean was refreshing but warm and the pools were heated. One suggestion would be to bring bug spray but no one can control mosquitoes at night, but if you dont have bug spray they have staff walking around with it to help you out. I only heard complaints from other nearby hotels because the staff didnt speak english and the food was getting them sick. NO WORRIES with Excellence though. My stay was fabulous and if I could go on a honeymoon again I would go back in a heartbeat.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESORT!! DEFINATELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH AND MUCH RELAXATION...

<Content>Had a great time! Great resort! Our flights were all on time. We travelled from Newark thru Atlanta to Punta Cana. One recomendation when is to get a direct flight down. Terrible Airport Delays in Atlanta. We were well prepared for the bumpy ride from the airport thanks to friends and trip advisor. No big deal really. As soon as we got to the resort we were welcomed with our Champagne. On arrival we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to the Excellence Club VIP. We did and I'm not sure if it is worth it or not. We did get a little special treatment and were not sure if that was standart or just because we upgraded. As far as what they promise is extra you have to chase them down for it. They say fresh fruit everyday, pillow service, fresh flowers. We never saw these and it took us 2 times asking to get our fresh fruit. Not that we really even wanted it, it was more that they did not deliver what they had promised. The Excellence Club itself was a nice place to get away. Honestly the food in the other dinning halls was way better. It's a great place to grab coffee in the am or have a drink before dinner in the evening. Our room was spotless. We never had a problem with bugs or anything. The power went our for a few hours the first night but wasn't a big deal. One thing I would recomend that we did was to buy Ridex. It's small gadget that plusgs into the wall and emits a frequency to keep the bugs away. That may be the reason we never saw any. It's about 20 bucks and well worth the investment. The water was rough and we were not allowed in the ocean the entire trip. We booked the Bavaro Splash which was great. They take you to the Bavaro side of Punta Cana. You get in a boat that takes you out to your own 2 person speed boat which you take about 15 min up the coat to a platform boat to snorkel. We had massages which were great. The spa is great. We went in the hot tub which was very clean and then had 2 pretty decent massages. The gym was great. State of the art equipment but not really great a/c. The food at the resort was pretty good. Almost everything had a fishy taste except the Grouper and the Shrimp. Nothing made us sick. I would avoid the Lobster House everyone we talked to had gotten sick from it. Chez Isabelle, Spice and Agave are the best. Our favorite was Spice. Overall a great trip. Not the Four Seasons but I don't think you will find one in the DR.

<Content>The Excellence Truly IS "Excellente" My Fiance and I chose this resort after alot of research and much help from the Punta Cana Forum on Trip Advisor. All the research paid off as this was the most prepared we have ever been for our vacation.The road, while certainly is not great, is only a bit rough for about 8 miles or so. New Yorkers like us, who are used to potholes like moon craters can certainly cope. We also had a fantasic Driver (Thanks Durran of VIP) who knew what he was doing.We arrived at the resort to a warm smile and an Hola from Eduardo, who handled getting our bags from the van, and gave us cool towels and a glass of the bubbly, which after traveling for nearly 12 hours, was a welcomed thing. Prepare yourselves people for while the open air lobby is lovely, it IS open air and it IS hot! Still the way that the building is ventilated, it is not unbearable and it makes the most of ocean breezes. Check in was a breeze and Hector is the consummate front desk man, making sure we knew where our room was in relation to the resort. He gave us a semi-upgrade to an Excellence Club room, which was in building seven room 7211. The hight ceiling with its ceiling fan was lovely but next time I think we will ask for a room without the vaulted ceiling as our friends room was cooler because of the lower ceiling. The room had a lovely garden view of fountains and palm trees from our cute little balcony. It was spotlessly clean with its four poster bed. The mattress was very firm, as we liked it and we were comfy indeed. The jetted tub did not work but it was fixed within one day and they even recaulked it! Adorable towel swans and rose petals and hibiscus blooms were strewn on the bed, the bathmat, by the tub and sink. The plasma TV was great and the minifridge was always filled with what we wanted. All we needed to do was ask.The only problem was sometimes the elevator, if it rains, did not work but the building is only three floors and we can handle a few stairs. Helped us work off all that yummy food!Tipping, while not a requirement, is helpful. This is NOT a rich country and these folks work long hours and make little. a dollar or two for the maid means so much. I even tried out my spanish, leaving little notes asking for things and, amazingly, Terecita and Christian understood me! These folks are honest so I had to be sure that our generous tip would not be viewed as an error and managed to explain it in spanish. That adorable lady gave me a warm hug and smile.Everyone smiles there. Ladies do not be surprised if you are offered an arm at the restaurants to be escorted to your chair. These folks KNOW what manners are. The food, while not 5 star gourmet, was very good and no one got sick. Our favorite was Barcelona. While not traditional spanish, it was fresh, well prepared and tasty. I loved the Paella. The three guitarists were a lovely touch and the men were so talented.Important fact: Shorts and covered up swimsuits and flip flops are fine for breakfast and lunch but the dress code of long pants for men and casual elegance for women (meaning no swimsuits or flip flops) is strictly adhered to at dinnertime. Also, only the indoor restaurants have Air conditioning, meaning Toscana, Agave, Spice Chez Isabelle. The Grill, The Lobsterhouse, and Oregano are outside. It is not too bad at night when a few breezes are niceToscana was great for breakfast with plenty of fresh fruit, egg dishes, yummy bacon and other buffet items, a smoothie bar, and made to order omlettes. The breads and pastries were fresh and yummy as well. Jennifer was always there with the most lovely smile. She made us both feel welcomed every morning.We were not fond of the salmon or yellow fin tuna at Chez Isabelle but other meals we had there were great. Really all the restaurants were good. The Grill, while tasty, was a bit dark and it was hard to see the menu. Agave had great service and a warm feeling. Oregano's pizza was very, very tasty. We did not do the lobster house as we just don't like Lobster. We would have gone to Spice if we had time and will try it next time.The restaurants could use some more ambiance as the menu covers were frayed and the table cloths needed updating. Miguel, the general manager said that they would be doing alot of updating of the restaurants and not only the decor but improving the menusj. It was already quite good and it will be interesting to see what Chef Bert will come up with.The BBQ on the beach was nice, the food plain but with all the new foods we were trying, it was welcomingly familiar. The Dominican dinner on the beach was great fun and yummy and that was where we met chef Bert,The Executive Chef graciously gave us a tour of his kitchens, which were so spotless and well run, the only way a person could get sick was from eating and drinking too much. Chef takes great pains in keeping things perfect. It was sobering to learn what it takes to keep the resort well fed. Ask him for a tour if he has the time. You will not be sorry.The pools are wonderful and clean. The animation team, including the hilarious Ines, Wainy, Johanna and others, kept us busy with volley ball, water polo and other games. Ines, we could not stop laughing with you. These folks work all hours and try hard to keep everyone happy, yet they are not intrusive, instinctivly knowing when to let my sweetie and I have our quiet time.No problems with floaties, beach chairs, beds or towels, which were almost always available. Our maid, when we asked, even put a few in our room so we would not have to look. No mosquitos or bugs either as the Resort does spray for them often but beware the nights! Get out the 98 percent deet or you will get bitten, especially after a rainstorm and at the Sports bar. We did not like it there much because of the mosquitos and the TV kept messing up. They need to move it elsewhere.The beach, with silky golden sand, was lovely and clean with water so clear and almost bath like. It was a bit rough, not for swiming but fun to play in. We felt safe with the life guard, who kept his eyes open. The drinks poolside are plentiful with pool side service but beware! They are STRONG. I liked the Mama Juana but a few of those will make you a bit crazy! Coco Locos, Sammy Sousas, Bananna Mama and Dirty Bananas were also great but watch those coconut based drinks. Too many and you will have a laxative effect!. Mango Martinis are a must try! Domingo, Victor, Jose, Marino (Thanks for the spanish/english book Marino, it helped!), Ramona, Reyna and too many others kept us all in drinks and laughter.The martini bar in the lobby was lovely when you wanted out of the sun as well as the tiny bar that is almost hidden between Chez Isabelle and Agave. That particular tiny bar is Air conditioned!Blue, the swim up bar was rowdy and full of hilarity. We made lots of friends there. Sol and Cielo were more quiet but still nice when Blue was just to insane. Cafe Kafe not only is right by the beach but has soft serve icecream! YUM!Pizza and sandwiches are periodically brought out to the pool for those of us too lazy to leave that wonderful pool.The shows were great, although not Las Vegas in quaility. These folks can DANCE! Michael Jackson show should not be missed and the 70's review is NOT all lipsinking! The gal that sand Donna Summers has one HECK of a voice. The Perfect Couple gameshow, while a bit cheesy, was gut busting funny and Domingo can sure play the sax! The Dominican show was full of their traditional dances and was interesting to see. Karaoke was just fun, with some great singers and some that THOUGHT they were great! Still, everyone was a good sport, even if the DJ sometimes could not find the songs. He called it a Dominican Problem!My only comment is that the resort does not promote this Jamaican singer/comedian, who sings the most HILARIOUSLY Xrated songs you can imagine! Be at the Piano Bar at 11pm mondays and fridays if you don't mind being a bit abused! Great stuff!The spa! Mille was heavenly and reasonable. Just ask for the specials. Julianna has golden hands and I reccommend the Excellence Massage. Santa was great, giving me a foot bath and because it was my birthday, pink balloons were up everywhere in my treatment room and happy birthday sung to me in spanish. It was sweet! Try the chloraphyl to ease that full tummy and detox you. Also if you look on the wall near the hot tub, it will tell you about how to give yourself hydrotherapy, a MUST if you eat and drink too much the night before!The bird sanctuary is great and there is a box of bread to feed the birds but if it is empty, Toscana will let you get bread from the buffett to feed them. The parrots can be found there and will come to your arm if you are carefull. If they raise one foot and look at you, then they will come to you but beware any shiney jewelry you were as they will yank it off you! Also they will eat the fruit out of your fruity drink and drink the drink as well! The Gym is state of the art with the best equiptment, cold towels, lots of bottled water and fresh fruit. The fruit is so good here! The nature walk is also lovely and if you want to learn some spanish, the gardeners will tell you the spanish names of the plantings.Speaking of spanish, everyone there speaks fair to flawless english but learn a bit of spanish. The staff appreciates the efforts and will try even HARDER to make you happy. Be polite and say Hola and Buenos Dias to the staff. If you talk to them, they will talk back and its more fun this way. There are spanish lessons offered. Just look at your Excellence Times, the newsletter that is sent to the room each day, depicting the next days events.There is an ATM by the reception desk, giving a proper exchange if you take money out in pesos. Thanks to Jackline for helping my sweetie use the darn thing! She was the soul of patience.Even when thinks went a bit wrong, like my Fiance ordering champagne, cake and ballons for my birthday, and they forgot the champagne and balloons, the staff finds a way to make it right, like with the balloons in the spa for me and the champange ice cold in the fridge the next day.Miguel, the general manager, knows alot about the bird life there and even got me to stop being scaredof the peacocks! He is very knowledgable and if you need anything at all, he will bend over backwards for you. The vendors come a few days a week and while a bit pushy, we had no problems buying lovely things at reasonable prices but you still do better if you go into Bavaro Plaza and bargin.Thanks again Terecita for the last night farewell gift of yours that includled that warm, rose petal stewn bath and lots of towel art! What a romantic way to end our odessy!In conclusion, Excellence IS excellent and is looking to improve all the time. We plan to have our wedding there as we love it so much. Punta Cana, with its lovely people, is our new home away from home.

<Content>second time around Just read the review from Never Again and had to write one myself. We stayed from oct 24-nov 2 2008 and our luggage was held up too. Only thing is, as always we took a carry on with a change of outfits just in case our luggage was held up. Luggage was deliverd to our room the next night. The staff could not have been more helpful even made calls to airline for us the first day. AA from JFK.We were here 15 months ago and find that since then the staff speaks better English then I speak Spanish. I found out that they even take english lessons.The beach and ocean was beautiful. The waves were never ending. The lifeguards did a great job of keeping us from harm way by reminding us not to stray to far out. As there were some strong rip currants. There was a lot of garbage on the beach past the hotel and this was being cleaned up. I think this was from the hurricane that had just been there a few weeks before. Also Altragracia was always at hand with a drink and a smile. Thank YouThe Spa was great and so was the staff.At night there was Domingo- Saxo to get you dancing.All in all it was a great time and will go back again.

<Content>Not as luxury as they advertise As a travel agent 8 other people as well as my husband and myself just spent a week at this so called 5 star luxury hotel, the pool areas are very nice BUT the rooms are dated, one couple had to move 3 times, power would go out in room and we had to play with the breakers to get power back up, hot tub in room did not work, bed spreads and towels felt old, air conditioning was always going off and it was VERY hot. Resturants, yes there is 7 to choose from one is closed every night.The best was Spice, Asian food, one couple ate here 5 out of 7 nights. Barcelona was terrible, the Grill an outside resturant was ok but you will fight the flies.Any kind of beef anyone ordered was either over cooked or fatty. A fly in the pasta one night was a turn off! The lunch buffet was good. 9 out of the 10 of us was sick, as well as other people I spoke to at the resort.The shows were great and the bars had premium liquors as advertised.This was my first trip to Punta Cana, travel companies tell you it is a 30 min. drive from the airport it is more like an hour and a half. Punta Cana is dirty with garbage being tossed everywhere.I will never return to Punta Cana and I will make sure my clients know also.

<Content>Don't Stay Here Just returned yesterday 11-01-08, we are still very sick. Everyone we spoke to was sick for some or all days of their stay here. You will not be able to get out of the bathroom and the stomach pain is awful. The food is not great nor even marginal, it would be very difficult to describe the beef as beef. Everyone on the plane home could not wait to get good food. The staff was very friendly and seemed willing to assist. The air conditioning is poor and it goes off in the middle of the night. The electricity in our room went out 5-8 times every day. We would know because many times we were not well enough to leave the room. A couple we meet there went for 4 days and could not get out of their room for 3. They both lost 6 lbs each. The resort looks beautiful, but if you are sick or not feeling well the entire stay it is not enjoyable.

<Content>Excellence was Excellente This place just fantastic. I went there with my new wife on our honeymoon and everything was great. the staff was amazing, the food was Frist class...I don't think I ate anything that I would not eat again. Everything tasted wonderful. Even the room service food was exceptional. Pedro, who works at the bar near the pools with a waterfull, was amazing. he remembered the drink that I always ordered and was always friendly when he saw me. All of the scenery and shrubs were always kept up and looking great. I reccommend taking advantage of the nightly shows and entertainment. There were only 2 negative things that we encountered. The first was that the bed was not as nice as expected. it did not have box springs and you could tell that the mattress was pretty old as there were 2 body imprints. we were really hoping for newer and more comfortable beds. the other thing that we did like as much was that this resort was far away from any real city so going into the city and just bartering with locals and spending the day on the town was out of the question. but, if you are planning on your honeymoon or vacation to just get away, relax and enjoy the sun, drinks and excellent food, then this place was amazing. I would definitely go back.

<Content>Excellence is Excellente! You are left with no doubt as to the standrard of service you will receive at Excellence Resort, Punta Cana when you are greeted with a glass of champaign and a cool towel immediately upon your arrival at the resort. The superior service never stops! The staff goes overboard to facilitate your every need. The live nightly entertainment is of Broadway caliber. (We're from New York, so we know.) The entire resort ,which we never got to see all of even though we were there for 7 days, is meticulously maintained. I would need an extra paragraph to describe the 9 restaurants on the resort grounds. Fabulous never ending food and drinks. Room service until 5:00am! All incredibly inclusive for an affordable adult only vacation!

<Content>Never again! Stayed at the Excellence from October 24th to October 28th.Our luggage was delayed. The hotel was aware of this when we checked in. We were not allowed in the Restaurants for dinner because my husband did not have long pants. We sat in our room for 2 days. Spent $102.00 on toothpaste, toothbrushes, bathsuit, suntan lotion etc..... It was not the Excellence fault that our lugguge was delayed, but at least help us feel comfortable. Conicierge was going to keep track of where our luggage was, they never did. She was so rude to us. Trying to communicate with the staff was difficulty because no one spoke English.Once they have your money, they really don't care!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY.

<Content>Loved every minute My wife and I stayed at the Excellence from Oct 15-22. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary but had never been on an overseas trip together so we really didn't know what to expect. We had talked to family  friends who had been to the DR and did much research into the resort on Trip Advisor. Thank the Lord, we couldn't have planned a nicer trip. We loved every minute and would go back to the Excellence in a heartbeat if we could.All the reviews we read had prepared us for the trip from the airport to the resort. The roads were very bumpy but our driver from Coco tours did a nice job of avoiding as many potholes as he could. Remember to take your Bonine if you are susceptible to car sickness. Driving through the countryside was interesting. My wife and I both were thinking to ourselves that we might have made a mistake in our destination choice until we entered the gates at the Excellence. We had stopped on the way to the Excellence at a couple of other resorts to drop other couples off and those resorts didn't even compare to the Excellence. The grounds at the Excellence were beautiful and well kept. You were greeted by friendly faces w/ a cold cloth and drink. Then we were guided to the folks at the Excellence Club. We did have the Excellence Club package and thought that it was worth it. You could get food or drink there all day if you preferred. Ricardo, Johan, Ana, Roberto, Magdilina and Carlos were really our family for the week. Their help with some problems we had w/ Expedia excursions was much appreciated. They couldn't do enough to make your stay Excellente . It was such a nice touch to have a prepared bubble bath awaiting us when we returned to our room after dinner on our last night there. All the staff members were courteous and helpful and always greeted you with a smile. Our room was great. Spacious enough for two and had a nice little patio and hammock in the yard. With the high bushes you still had your privacy. The room was clean, and cool, the bed was comfortable.At the Excellence you can do as much or as little as you want. There are plenty of daily activities. My wife and I were there to celebrate a second honeymoon and to be together, enjoy each other and relax. This was the perfect place for it. As I said the grounds were beautiful with many different kinds of flowers dotting the walking paths. Birds and butterflies were everywhere. The beach was great and big enough so that you could find your own quiet place to chill. The water was warm and a little rough but as was stated in the other reviews, you could go down the beach to the right around the bend a little way and wade out into a calmer area. My wife and I did this on a few occassions and had the area all
